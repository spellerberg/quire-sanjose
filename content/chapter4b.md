## Matachines

Matachines are societies or sodalities of dancers who perform ritual dances. The particular dance performed by matachines in Texas has been performed by Native American and Hispanic populations for hundreds of years. Many scholars say that the Maatachia dance (la Danza de Matachines) has its origins as “The Dance of the Moors and Christians”. In Texas, the societies are tied to a parish and often venerate Our Lady of Guadalupe. The instruments used to accompany the dance, drums and rattles, suggest that la Danza de Matachines performed in Austin originated in north-west Mexico (Matachines, the Handbook of Texas Online, accessed August 2018).

Los Matachines de la Santa Cruz de la Ladrillera of Loredo, Texas, was probably the first matachin group in Texas, arriving in Texas in the 1940s. It became famous when it performed in San Antonio in 1988. In Austin, the society may have first appeared at Cristo Rey Parish. The first mention of the Matachines in San José Parish was in 1992 in connection with the Mañanitas (Cristo Rey Parish website).

In November 1992, the Sunday Bulletin had an announced that people were invited to learn traditional dances and prayer offerings from indigenous people to Our Lady of Guadalupe. Practice was on Saturday from 11:00AM to 1:00PM in the old church. The dances would be performed on December 12 (223:01/11/1992).

## Men’s Club

A Men’s Club existed at San José Church from the late 1950s until 1963 and again from 1974 until 1975. The two Men’s Clubs had different functions and a different membership. The two groups shared only the name.   

The Men’s Club of 1960-1963 prepared the Sunday Bulletin (223:03/05/61), sponsored the annual Mardi Gras Dance (223:01/29/61) and managed the distribution of Sunday Collection envelopes (223:10/15/61). Perhaps the most important function of the Club was to visit parishioners in their homes and ask them to pledge 5% of their income to the church (223:12/29/63).

The purpose of the Men’s Club of 1974-1975 was “to draw willing workers into an effective Christian group” (249: 17/02/74). This Men’s Club was soon opened to women (249:21/04/74) and had a social program (250:17/11/74) (223:07/09/75). It was a sodality (249:24/02/74) and its members attended a corporate mass each month (223:17/08/75). It was not a fundraising organization although the group sponsored booths in the parish bazaar in the spring (223:02/05/76) and at the Jamaica in the fall of the year (223:07/09/75).  

### 1960-1963

The Men’s Club of 1960-1963 must have existed prior to 1960 but no written records exist prior to 1960. It may have originated in 1957 when the second San Jose Church was built. Although club took on other tasks, its main task was to increase the Sunday Collections. To accomplish this task, the Men’s Club visited parishioners in their homes and asked them to support the Plan of San José and to tithe 5% of their income to the church (223:12/29/63). The Men’s Club handled the distribution of Sunday Collection envelopes (223:10/15/61) and tallied and report each family’s annual donation to the church (223:01/01/61).

The Men’s Club met on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month at 7:30PM (223:12/04/60) (223:12/18/60) (223:12/25/60) (223:04/09/61). The meetings were moved if Tuesday was a Holy Day of Obligation to allow the men to attend Mass on that day (223:08/13/61). Frequent meetings were necessary because the pastor tasked the club with reporting each parishioner’s donation to Sunday Collections for the prior year (223:01/01/61). Some of the meetings were social events and Captains were urged to bring their groups with them to those meetings (223:12/04/60). There were nineteen Captains. The Men’s Club divided the parish into seven divisions. Each division was assigned a chairman and an assistant. Nineteen Captains headed groups who were assigned to visit and monitor a block of parishioners. A President and a Vice President completed the club’s organizational structure (223:10/01/61).

The pastor assigned the Men’s Club several tasks. In 1961, the Men’s Club was in charge of the Saturday Mardi Gras Dance at the City Coliseum. The dance was a benefit for the church (223:01/29/61). The Chairman of the Social Committee assigned men to sell tickets and to manage table reservations. The net profit of the dance in 1961 was $508 (223:02/19/61). The Men’s Club was also responsible for preparing the Sunday Bulletin that was distributed to all parishioners after each Sunday Mass beginning in December 1960 (223:03/05/61).

In September 1961, the Men’s Club began preparing to visit parishioners in their homes and to distribute Sunday Collection envelopes for the coming year (223:10/15/61). Chairmen of the seven divisions and their assistants were selected and Captains were named (223:10/01/61). In November, the Men’s Club distributed the new envelopes at the entrance to the church after Sunday Masses and people were asked to make their pledges for the Sunday offering for the coming year (223:11/12/61). Any boxes of envelopes not picked up in November were delivered to the parishioner’s home (223:03/24/63). By December 31, 1961, the Men’s Club had distributed 490 boxes of envelopes and, in January, the Men’s Club mailed a card to each family showing their donations to the Sunday Collection for 1961 (223:12/31/61). In February 1962, the Men’s Club planned for the annual Mardi Gras Dance on March 3rd (223:02/11/62).

In the fall of 1962, the system used in prior years to distribute collection envelopes had broken down. In March 1963, the pastor wrote in the Sunday Bulletin, “You have noticed 150 boxes of envelopes at the entrance of the Church since Christmas. Formerly we used to take these boxes to the homes” (223:03/24/63). A month later, he noted, “There are 72 boxes of envelopes on the table at the entrance of the church. If some of you men would kindly take them to the homes, you would do a favor to San José and possibly be the source of blessings for those families” (223:03/03/63). Who eventually delivered the boxes of envelopes to the parishioners’ homes is unknown.

Apparently, the Men’s Club had stopped functioning by the spring of 1963. In December 1963, the pastor urged someone to take charge of the distribution of the Sunday Collection envelopes. He said, “The men who do such good work for the Religion Classes for the Youth, would they do San Jose another favor? As you visit homes, take with you the envelopes still on the table and explain to the people the Plan of San José, that they donate 5 cents on every dollar they earn (223:12/29/63). In January 1964, the pastor wrote, “There are some 200 boxes of envelopes still on the table. We would like to ask the men to take these to the owners” (223:01/12/64). Eventually, it was the Socios, rather than the Men’s Club, who delivered the boxes (223:03/01/64).

### 1974-1975

In February 1974, another group, also called the Men’s Club, was formed with Sam Guerra, President; Byron Highfill, Vice-President; Henry (Bubba) Saenz Jr., Secretary; Raymond Samilpa Jr. Treasurer; and Rev. Mike Mikan, Chaplain. The purpose of this Men’s Club was, “to draw willing workers into an effective Christian group”. The Men’s Club initially met on the second Wednesday of each month at 7:30PM in the school’s meeting room (249: 24/03/74). All men over 18 years of age were invited to join. Other founding members included Benny Limón Sr., Roger Ibarra, Pete Casarez Sr., and Tom Álvarez (249: 17/02/74).

Club members paid no dues and funded their activities by fundraising. One of their first activities was to sponsor a dance in the San José Community Center (249: 24/02/74). The club was a sodality and celebrated their corporate mass at the 12:00 noon Mass on the third Sunday of the month. The members met at the Community Center immediately followed the Mass to socialize (249: 09/06/74) (223:18/05/75) but the Club’s business meeting was on Wednesday at 7:30PM (249: 05/05/74).

On May 5, 1974, the club was opened to women over 18 years of age (249:21/04/74) and, in June new officers were elected (237). The Men’s Club hosted a barbecue supper at the Catholic War Veterans hall at 4913 S. Congress Avenue where they sold a plate of barbecued meat for $1.50 (249:19/05/74). The Club continued to meet monthly (250:10/11/74) and, in November 1974, the Men’s Club sponsored a fishing trip for its members (250:17/11/74).

In March 1975, the Men’s Club voted to donate $150 to the Boy’s Club of South Austin who lost most of their uniforms and library in a fire. On Saturday night, April 5, the Men’s Club sponsored a dance with Nash Hernandez and his Orchestra. The tickets were $5 at the door and beer was sold at half price from 8PM to 9PM (223:23/03/75).

New officers were elected in June 1975 at a Monday night meeting in the San José School (223:15/06/75). Four officers and chairmen of four standing committees were elected. The four committees were a Religious Committee, Telephone Committee, Social Committee and Fund Raising Committee. The monthly business meeting was changed to Sunday after the 12:00AM corporate Communion (223:17/08/75). Families of Club members were invited to attend the corporate communion and sit with the members (223:07/09/75).

In the fall of 1975, the Men’s Club sponsored a booth at San José Church Fiesta on August 24 and sponsored a dance in September (223:21/09/75). On a Saturday in September, members and their wives were invited to play volleyball at the church volleyball court (223:07/09/75). In October, the Club planned a retreat for its members (223:19/10/75) and in November sponsored another dance at the San José Community Center (223:26/10/75). The dances were fundraisers with tickets priced high enough to discourage any teenagers who might want to attend (223:21/09/75). The Club also experimented with a tardiada (afternoon social event) that took place in the Community Center from 2:00PM to 6:00PM. The music was provided by Los Tremendos Gavilanes de Juan y Salomon de Monterrey (223:05/10/75).

In April 1976, the Men’s Club held their monthly meeting after 12:00 noon Mass to discuss plans for the annual church bazaar. The Men’s Club sponsored a dance on May 1 with Ruben Sanchez providing the music. The purpose of the dance was to raise money for the bazaar (223:24/04/76). On Sunday May 2, the Club sponsored four food booths at the annual Church Bazaar. One of the booths was a beer garden where beer by the glass was sold (223:02/05/76). The Men’s Club was no longer mentioned in the Sunday Bulletin after May 1976.

## Movimiento Familiar

Movimiento Familiar Cristiano is a Catholic organization that originated in Chicago in 1943. It was organized on the national level in 1969 and became el Movimiento Familiar Cristiano en Español de los Estados Unidos (MFC/USA) in 1976. It was reorganized as a non-profit foundation in 2007 under the name Movimiento Familiar Cristiano Catholico-USA. Its purpose is to strengthen the family.

The first time the Movimiento Familiar Cristiano was mentioned in the San José Sunday Bulletin was in 1990. In February, the Bulletin announced an Encuentro Conyugal in San Marcos. The announcement said, “The Movimiento Familiar Cristiano de la Diocesis de Austin patrocio un Encuentro Conyugal a sus matrimonios de su parroquia Feb. 9, 10 & 11 en San Marcos” (223:04/02/1990).

Three years later, in February 1993, a Grupo Jovenil was organized in San José Parish by Rev. Damian Hinojosa. The youth group met in the school after 12:30PM to discuss the role of the Bible in marriage and the requirements for a Catholic wedding (223:28/02/1993). The March 14 Sunday Bulletin carried a similar message but called the group was called “grupo hispano” (22314/03/1993). On March 21, a similar announcement called the group Joven Entusiasta (223:21/03/1993). In the list of Activities This Week, it was called Grupo Hispano (223:14/03/1993). In May the name was Union Juvenil (223:16/05/1993).

This was clearly a group of young Spanish-speaking parishioners who were in the process of forming a new parish organization. On May 9, the group organized an outing to Parque de las Flores (223:09/05/1993) and in July “El Grupo Hispano de Jovenes Adultos” sponsored a birthday event July 18 at 12:30PM. The contact for the group that was listed in the Sunday Bulletin was Jesús Tamayo and Luís Miranda (223:18/07/1993).

Whether or not this group evolved into the Movimiento Familiar that exists at San José Parish in 2018 is uncertain. However, it was the first for a new generation of sodalities in the parish consisting of recently arrived immigrants from Mexico. This new generation of Mexican immigrants revived and in some ways displaced the native-born children of Mexican immigrants who grew up in the Parish. The use of Spanish was revived rather than disappearing as previous pastors had assumed it would.

In 2018, parish planning meetings are either completely bilingual or mostly in Spanish. The children of these Hispanics, most of who were born and raised in Austin, resemble in many ways the children of previous generations of Mexican immigrants to Austin. They live in a bilingual, bicultural environment and are completely at home in both the Mexican and American cultural milieus. The difference between them and children of Mexican immigrants born in Texas in 1930 and 1940 is the absence of racial discrimination against their language and their culture that the older generation endured. Only time will tell how that will affect them and the city they live in.

## San José PTA

Classes began at the new San José Parochial School in September 1957 with two teachers and ninety-two Kindergarten and 1st grade students (86) (211) (235). Parents and teachers created some kind of help committee as early as 1958 (235) and by December 1960 a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) existed at the San José School.

The PTA began having monthly meetings in September and stopped meeting in May (223:09/10/61) (223:05/07/61). General meetings of the PTA took place on Monday night at 8:00PM with teachers available for counseling an hour earlier (223:01/08/61). Officers for the schoolyear were elected in October for the first six or seven years (223:10/15/61). Beginning in May 1966, PTA officers for the next school year were elected in May (223:05/01/66).

The pastor considered the PTA to be a sodality and the PTA, like other sodalities at San Jose, attended Communion as a group once a month. The Guadalupanas, the Veterans and PTA all received Communion as a group on the 2nd Sunday of the month but at different Mass times (223:12/04/60).

### PTA, 1961-1962

In 1961, the PTA officers consisted of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Pro-Secretary and a Treasurer. The PTA sponsored a Cub Scout troop and Cub Scout Master, Frank Gonzalez, was listed as an officer of the PTA (223:10/15/61).

### PTA, 1962-1963

Four new officers were elected in September (223:09/16/62). In October, some members suggested that the PTA host a weekly bingo for the benefit of the school (223:10/21/62). The following month, the PTA began to host bingo in the Community Center at 8:00PM on Wednesday (223:11/04/62). The PTA Party Games committee had a membership of six persons who ran the games (223:04/21/63).

The PTA voted to buy a refrigerator for the school cafeteria (223:04/14/63). Sr. and Sra. Steve Botello purchased the refrigerator for $288. The money from the bingo hosted by the PTA was also used to buy chalkboards for the third grade classroom.

Each class from Kindergarten to Grade 7 had one to three room mothers. Room mothers were parents of students and PTA members who assisted the teacher. They were not usually teacher’s aides. In November, the room mothers were assigned the task of preparing and managing the annual school Christmas Party. The PTA Party Games Committee donated the money for the Christmas Party (223:11/17/63).

### PTA, 1964-1965

Officers were elected at the first PTA meeting of the schoolyear. The meetings were on Monday nights at 7:30PM in the school (223:09/13/64). Four officers were elected (223:10/04/64) and room mothers were recruited. Each grade was assigned two room mothers except for Kindergarten that had four and the grades 7-8 class had one. A Room Mother Committee was formed with a chairperson and a vice-chairperson (223:10/04/64).

In February and March, the PTA had a cake sale (223:03/28/65) and a rummage sale to raise money to buy essential sanitation supplies for the school bathrooms (223:02/21/65). The cake sale raised $70.25 and the rummage sale raised $24.05 (223:03/07/65). The PTA occasionally screened documentary films on Sundays at 7:30PM. Tickets were sold for 35 or 15 cents (223:03/07/65) (223:04/25/65).

In 1965, the PTA was actively raising funds for a new school building. In May, the PTA sponsored a carnival on May 9 and a school picnic on May 16 at Bergstrom Air Base (223:05/02/65). The carnival was well publicized and well attended. It raised $609 for the new school (223:05/23/65). On Sunday April 4, the PTA served beef barbecue plates with beans, potato salad and bread for $1 from 10:00AM to 2:00PM (223:03/28/65). The PTA was involved in designing the new school and, in May, the architect met with the PTA about the new school (223:05/09/65).

The PTA had seven Committees. The committees and their chairpersons were: Room Mothers-Frances Trevino; Teachers’ Aid-Leonor Simmons; Membership and Finance-Ben Vega; Programs and Safety-Roger Anthony; Publicity-Rosie Cantu; Physical Education-Concepcion Reyna and New School-Guadalupe Vesquez

### PTA, 1965-1966

New PTA officers and committees were elected in October 1965. In addition to the four officers, twenty-four ladies volunteered as room mothers or teacher’s aides and sixteen PTA members served on four committees. Five of the sixteen committeemen were women (223:10/03/65).

San José PTA helped with the ground breaking of the new San José elementary school on October 24, 1965. The PTA President, Sgt. Gilbert Gonzalez, U.S.M.C., welcomed a crowd of over 600 people who witnessed the ceremony (37) (38). Guadalupe Vasquez was chairman of the PTA Building Committee (37).

The PTA continued to raise money for the new school after construction began. In December, the PTA Finance Committee sponsored a raffle to buy shelves and books for the library of the new school (223:12/05/65) and, on February 13, the PTA sold cakes after each Mass (223:02/13/66). The Bingo kitchen crew earned $311.39 for the school selling snacks at the weekly bingo games (223:02/20/66).

### PTA, 1966-1967

PTA officers for the coming schoolyear were elected in May 1966. The officers were a president, a vice president, a secretary, a treasurer and a pro-treasurer. Three of the five officers were women (223:05/29/66). During this school year, the PTA met every second Monday instead of once a month (223:08/28/66).

In September, the PTA sponsored a Rummage and Bake Sale in the Cafeteria (223:08/28/66) and, later in the month, another Cake Sale (223:09/25/66). “The last cake sale of the PTA brought in over $100” (223:10/09/66). The PTA also sponsored the Wednesday night bingo games (223:02/19/67).

The PTA President was the Master of Ceremonies when the Bishop came to bless the new school (223:11/06/66) and PTA members were assigned to show visitors the new school (223:10/16/66).

### PTA, 1967-1968

Four new officers were elected in May 1967. PTA officers rarely served more than one year and usually the entire slate of officers was replaced every year (223:05/14/67). In December, the PTA hosted a meeting of its members in an effort to explain modern mathematics to parents (223:11/26/67).

The pastor reported that income from 1967 included $6,802 from bazaars and fiestas. The Guadalupanas raised most of that money but the PTA raised some of it (223:01/21/68). Rev. Haley told a reporter that that the PTA was among the seventh largest organizations at San José Church (122). New officers were elected at the last meeting of the school year on May 14 (223:05/12/68) (223:07/07/68).

### PTA, 1968-1969

The PTA sponsored five booths at the July 28 Parish Bazaar. Three of the booths were children’s games (penny pitch, ring-a-coin and fish pond). The other booths sold snow cones and soft drinks (223:07/21/68). In 1968-1969, the PTA had four officers and eleven committees. Each committee had a chairperson and her assistants. The committees were Program, Publicity, Safety/Civil Defense, Playground, Courtesy Budget and Finance, Membership, Drill Team, Room Mother, Scholarship and Hospitality (223:10/06/68).

In 1968, the parish bazaar was on July 28 (223:07/21/68). Another parish-wide event was a picnic on September 29 at Zilker Park (223:09/15/68). There was no Jamaica or similar parish-wide fall fair in 1968. This created a fundraising opportunity for the PTA and on Sunday, October 27, the PTA sponsored a bazaar to raise money for the school. The bazaar began at 10:00AM in the morning and continued until 8:00PM. The bazaar was followed by a dance (“record hop”) for children from 8:00PM to 10:00PM (223:10/20/68).

In October 1968, the PTA announced it would host bingo games on Friday night instead of the Wednesday night game they had hosted since 1962 (223:10/20/68). The PTA sold Christmas cards in November and candy in December to raise funds for the school (213) (223:12/01/68). The sale of Christmas card brought in roughly $350 (223:12/15/68).

### PTA, 1969-1970

The PTA sponsored three booths at the May 4 Bazaar. Two booths, tick-tack-toe and fish pond, were games for young children. The PTA sold cakes from a third booth to raise funds for the church (213) (223:04/27/69). The year before the PTA had sponsored a Drill Team at San Jose School. In July, Rev. Bob Gilmour told the Parish Council that there were plans underway to organize a new Scout troop at San Jose and that he was looking for a scoutmaster (213). He suggested that the PTA sponsor the Scout troop instead of the Drill Team (213). The PTA resisted this suggestion. They knew that Scouting failed twice before at San José because of lack of interest on the part of parents and children (223:08/17/69).

Nevertheless, the Parish Council formed a Scout Troop 94 Committee and announced the formation of an Explorer Scout Post (223:08/03/69). Eventually, the commander of the San Jose Post of the Catholic War Veterans, Roger Ibarra, told the Parish Council that the CWV Post 1085 would sponsor Troop 94. It was agreed that the Brownies would also meet in the renovated youth center barracks rather than at Molly Dawson School (213). Boy Scout Troop 94 had their first meeting on August 8 with Franklin Mendez was the Scoutmaster and Fr. Bob Gilmore as Assistant Scoutmaster (223:08/10/69).

In January, the PTA was able to donate $1,767.05 to help pay the six-month installment and interest payments on the school and the new hall (223:01/04/70). During 1969, the PTA also donated $2,158.03 for book and supplies for the school (233:03/01/70). Much of this money came from the weekly bingo games hosted by the PTA. Beginning in 1970, PTA meetings were moved from Monday to Tuesday at 8:00PM in the school (223:03/22/70).

### PTA, 1970-1971

The PTA began the 1970-1971 schoolyear with a fundraiser. Volunteers sold breakfast in the Community Center for 75 cents a plate (223:09/05/70). Three weeks later, the PTA sponsored a school picnic at Zilker Park from 3:00PM to 6:00PM with piñatas, games, ice cream and candy for the students attending the San Jose School (223:09/27/70). In November, the PTA began serving breakfast after the 8:00AM and 10:00AM Masses every Sunday in the Community Center (223:11/01/70).                                                                      
The children, too, were asked to help raise funds for the school. The cheerleaders sold cakes after the 8:00AM, 10:00AM and 12:00noon Masses to raise money to buy equipment for their team (223:10/25/70) and the school children were given Christmas cards to sell (223:10/25/70). The children sold the cards at the entrance to the church after 8:00AM, 10:00AM and 12:00noon Mass on November 15 (223:11/15/70).  The price was $1 for 21 cards (223:11/22/70). Even the three teaching Sisters started a fundraiser. They asked parishioners to bring them used postage stamps that they planned to sell (223:11/15/70) (223:11/29/70).

Towards the end of 1970, the PTA met with Dr. McIntosh from the Catholic Conference to discuss possible state aid to parochial schools (223:12/06/70). The financial situation of the school was untenable. The junior high school grades (7th and 8th) were not offered in the 1970-1971 schoolyear because the school could not raise the money to keep them open (12) (86). In 1970-1971, the school enrolled 91 students (213).

During the 1970-1971 schoolyear, the PTA ran bingo games at the Community Center on Friday nights. In 1970, they earned $9,638.34 from the bingo games (223:01/03/71). They combined this with other money and donated $12,179.63 for schoolbooks and utilities (223:01/31/71). David Laurel was the chairman of the PTA Bingo Committee and ran the Friday night Bingos (223:06/06/71).

Fundraising continued in 1971. The 1st grade mothers sold cakes after Mass on Feb. 14 to buy materials for the children (223:02/14/71). In April, a bicycle was raffled to raise money to help with the school bills (223:04/04/71). The bike was donated by Kroger’s Family Discount Center (223:04/11/71).

In the 1970-1971 schoolyear, the PTA met on Tuesday evening at 8:00PM (223:04/11/71). Elections for officers of the coming year took place at the May 11 meeting (223:05/09/71). After the new officers were in place, they voted to donate $500 to help the parish purchase a new station wagon (223:07/11/71).

### PTA, 1971-1972

During the 1971-1972 schoolyear, the PTA met at the Community Center on Tuesdays at 7:30PM (223:10/10/71). During the calendar year of 1971, the PTA donated $9,640.81 to purchase school books and pay utilities at the school (223:13/02/72). This money came from the Friday night bingo games. The income from the Monday and Wednesday night bingo games run by the Socios was substantially higher and was used to pay down the mortgage debt on the school and the Community Center. In 1971, the Socios donated $11, 467.50 to pay the principle and interest on the school debt and $14, 026.25 on the principle and interest on the hall debt (223:13/02/72). The PTA ran seven booths at the annual San Jose bazaar in May. They earned $590 from the seven booths (223:21/05/72).

### PTA, 1972-1973

During the 1972-1973 schoolyear, the enrollment at San Jose School was 81 students (86) and the Parish Council voted to close the school at the end of the schoolyear (12). The Parish Council decided that it was unfair to use the resources of the parish to support a school that was attended by only a small minority of the children at San José (12).

In March 1973, the PTA donated $16,977.98 to pay school salaries and utilities from the profits from the Friday Night Bingo Games (223: 25/03/73). After the school closed, the PTA disbanded. However, the debt on the school loan remained. The Friday Night Bingo Games continued but were managed by a group of Socios from the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus (249: 18/11/73).

### PTA after 1973

After the school closed, the San Jose School building was renamed the San José CCD Center although the sign on the front of the building was never changed. It was used for CCD, baptismal, First Communion and first confession classes (223:05/01/75).

When the school closed, the parish still owed $110,000 on the building (223:07/11/71). Ten years later, the parish had three outstanding notes, for the school, for the renovation of the church and for the Community Center (223:21/11/82). The semi-annual payments of interest and principal on the school and the Community Center of about $10,000 were due on January 1st and July 1st each year (223:01/05/83) (223:18/03/84). The final payment on the school building was made on July 1, 1986.

## Society of Saint Vincent de Paul

The first conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in the Diocese of Austin was established at St. Mary’s parish in Waco in 1953. Men from the Extension Committee of the SVDP of the Archdiocese of San Antonio visited Austin on various occasions in 1959 seeking those interested in working with the Society. St. Vincent de Paul conferences were established in five Austin parishes in 1961. The first parish conference was established at Dolores in May 1961 followed in that same year by Conferences at Holy Cross, St. Mary’s Cathedral, Cristo Rey and St. Louis (272).

What became the District Council of Austin was formed in October 1962. The first officers of the district council were from St. Louis, Dolores and St. Mary Cathedral Parishes. Some of these leaders were inspired by their participation in the Cursillo movement. A conference was established at San José Church on January 21, 1963 and, ten months later in October 1963, a conference was formed at St. Ignatius Martyr Parish (272).

### Thrift Store open in 1963

In 1963, The Ladies of Charity and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul jointly opened a store selling secondhand furniture, appliances and clothing at 319 E. 6th Street. Previously, the Ladies of Charity operated a store on East 1st (or 2nd) Street selling second-hand clothing. The men of the St. Vincent de Paul Society operated a near-by store that sold furniture and appliances. Within a few months, the two organizations formed the Austin St. Vincent de Paul Store Board to run the stores as a joint venture. The responsibilities of running the store and the profits were to be split equally between the Ladies of Charity and the SVDP Society. A volunteer staff of Vincentians and Ladies of Charity operated the stores. The purpose of the store was, “to provide a storehouse of clothing and furniture for poor families of the community and to provide, at a reasonable cost, the things that poor people need” (272).

In December 1963, the Sunday Bulletin announced that the Conference of the St. Vincent de Paul Society at San José was ready to help the poor of the parish. On January 26, 1964 the Society sold cakes and pies after each Mass as a fundraiser (223:01/26/64). Sometime prior to March 1972, the parish began taking a second collection for the Saint Vincent de Paul Society (223: 05/03/72). The second collection was then called the Black Bag. The pastor announced that, “This collection will be given to the Society for the needy families of the parish” (223:04/06/72). A typical “Black Bag” collection at San José in 1973 might amount to $90 (249:11/11/73).

The Conferences at San José and St. Ignatius Martyr usually met together and eventually formed a joint Conference. In January 1975, the two conferences met at the rectory at St. Ignatius (223:12/01/75) (223:05/02/75). Frank Wolfe of St. Ignatius was the President of the joint Conference (223:09/03/75). The Saint Vincent de Paul Society and the Ladies of Charity of Austin worked closely together and the Ladies of Charity occasionally invited parishioners at San José to attend Mass and attend a meeting at Holy Cross Hospital (223:11/01/76).

The Ladies of Charity and the Saint Vincent de Paul Society also jointly operated the thrift store. The location of the rented SVDP stores changed frequently and sometimes the Board operated two stores, usually north of the Colorado River. In 1976, the Board opened a second store at 501 W. Oltorf Street in South Austin (272). The Ladies of Charity and SVDP jointly operated the St. Vincent de Paul Southside store (223:10/09/76).

In 1978, the joint Conference of San Jose and St. Ignatius met at San José on Tuesdays at 7:30PM (223:17/10/78). In 1981, Joe Juranek of St. Ignatius Conference of SVDP, was elected to serve as the President of the Austin District Council. In July, joint San José-St. Ignatius Conference hosted a meeting of the Particular Council of Austin at St. Ignatius on a Monday evening in July (223:12/07/1981). The society had no office space and operated of parishes and the Vincentian’s homes. At this meeting, Joe Juranek reported that, during June 1981, 611 people received assistance from the joint San Jose-St. Ignatius Conference at a cost of $3,145.10. This number included 368 individuals who received food (costing $900) from the food pantry (223:19/07/1981).

### The Thrift Store moved to S. Congress Avenue

In 1981, the South Austin SVDP Southside store moved from W. Oltorf Street to 1500 S. Congress Ave. In about 1990, the Board purchased the building at 1327 South Congress Avenue, moved the Southside store there and closed its store in downtown Austin north of the river. The SVDP Thrift Store remained at the South Congress Avenue location until 2016 when the building was sold and the thrift store moved to Braker Lane in north Austin (272).

In June 1982, Margarita Juarez Gomez, who was then a County Constable, organized of a successful effort to raise money for St. Vincent de Paul (223:20/06/82). The fundraiser was a Saturday night dance at the San José Community Center. The 12:00AM Choir, including Tony Castillo, Terry Acuña and Margaret Gomez sponsored the dance (223:30/05/82). Richard Moya donated the beer, Conjuncto Carinito donated the music and many people sold tickets (including Enrique and Elena Flores who sold $285 of tickets to the dance) (223:11/07/82).

Fundraisers, such as the dance, increased people’s awareness of the work of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and the Black Bag Second collection totals increased. In December, the SVDP second collection was $200.20 (223:19/12/82). The San Vincent de Paul joint conference was based at St. Ignatius Parish and individuals from San José Parish who needed assistance to advised to go there.

The Conference at St. Ignatius was much wealthier and had more members (Vincentians) than that at San José. The annual total for the second Black Bag collection at St. Ignatius for 1982 was $34,764. During the same year, the San José Black Bag collection was $1,187. The Conference at St. Ignatius also had other sources of income. The total income of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at St. Ignatius for 1982 was $68,913. They helped 10,228 persons, mostly with food. A copy of their 1982 report was placed inside the San José Sunday Bulletin during the month of December 1982 (223:26/12/82).

During 1983, the Sunday Bulletin regularly reported on activities of the joint San Jose-St. Ignatius Conference of St. Vincent de Paul. The second collection for SVDP was on the First Sunday of each month (223:06/02/83) (223:27/02/83). The amount collected was reported monthly and ranged from $75.20 in January (223:09/01/83) to $812.20 in November (223:13/11/83). The money collected at San José was sent to the joint Conference at St. Ignatius Church (223:10/04/83).

### Joe Juranek managed the Joint Conference

This arrangement work well. Joe Juranek issued monthly report to San José parishioners detailing the number of people helped and how much was spent (223:26/06/83). During December 1983, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at St. Ignatius distributed 100 Food Baskets and helped 1,034 persons with $7,201.41, mostly for fuel bills because of “the paralyzing cold”. The Black Bag collection at St. Ignatius was $3,655 and at San José $752 in December (223:29/01/84).

During 1984, the combined San José and St. Ignatius Conference continued to aid large numbers of people. During February, the combined Conferences assisted 861 people with $5,450. Often the assistance offered was not monetary. The pastor noted, “Sometimes just listening is very important’ (223:18/03/84). The amount donated by San José parishioners to the Society also increased but was still only about one-tenth of that received from the parishioners of St. Ignatius Parish  (223:11/03/84) (223:12/08/84).

A St. Ignatius + San Jose Society of St. Vincent de Paul financial report appeared in a Sunday Bulletin in November 1984. The joint conference had total expenses of $73,678 and assisted 11,360 people. The St. Ignatius Conference also had a full-time employee (Joe Juranek). Anyone from San José Parish needing financial assistance was referred to Mr. Juranek (223:11/18/84).

The second collection was not the only source of funds for the joint San José-St. Ignatius Conference. The pastor reported that the parish had raised $5,472.90 for SVDP in 1983 and $8,568.03 in 1984. This figure was about $3,000 higher than the Black Bag collections. It is not clear where the extra money came from (223:03/02/1985).

### The Joint Conference was recognized in 1985

In April 1985, the SVDP Council General in Paris, France formally recognized the combined San José-St. Ignatius Conference (272) and, in March 1985, the Black Bag collection at San José exceeded $1,000 for the first time (223: 10/03/1985). The Black Bag collection remained at or above $1,000 each month for the rest of 1985 and into 1986 (223:14/04/1985) (223:09/06/1985) (223:08/12/1985) (223:09/03/1986) (223:13/04/1986) (223:11/05/1986) (223:13/07/1986). The February 1986 report of the combined Conference showed that the Conference has assisted 1,519 persons during the month at a cost of $9,867.45.

The February 1986 report also listed the donations received by the joint conference. The donations received were St. Ignatius Black Bag $4,534.86; Ash Wednesday collection $2,308.26; San José second collection $1,011.66; private donors $337.00; SVDP District Council $1,000.00 for total donations of $9,191.78 during the month (223; 09/03/1986).
The pastor periodically reminded parishioners that San José sent their St. Vincent de Paul monthly collection to St. Ignatius and that St. Ignatius had a full-time social worker that helped with groceries, utilities, etc. San José parishioners were urged to go there for help during regular business hours of 8:00AM to 5:00PM M-F (223: 01/06/1986).

In August 1986, the pastor, Fr. Underwood, suggested that each person tithe 8% for the Regular Sunday Collection and 2% for the monthly St. Vincent de Paul Collection (or other second collection) (223:14/09/1968). During this period, the second collection for SVDP averaged around $1,000 per month (223:10/08/1986) (223:14/10/1968). The Black Bag collection continued to average about $1,000 per month until 1988 when it increased to about $1,400 per month (223:14/12/1986) (223:10/04/1988) (223:08/05/1988).

In 1987 and 1988, although the parishioners of San José continued to support the joint San José-St. Ignatius Conference by their monthly donations to the second collection (223:08/03/1987) (223:14/06/1987) (223:13/09/1987), the Conference at San José had few members. In January 1988, when St. Vincent de Paul was seeking more volunteers, the pastor commented that, “As you know, San José and St. Ignatius work together on this but San José has very few workers compared to St. Ignatius” (223:10/01/1988). The principal function of the volunteers (the Vicentians) was to visit the poor in their homes. Apparently much of this work was taken care of by the social worker at St. Ignatius and few home visits were made.

In November 1988, the pastor said that San José parishioners donated $18,000 or more to SVDP in 1988 (223:20/11/1988). The monthly collection varied from about $400 to $1,500 but was reliably above $1,300 (223:1989).

### SVDP provided emergency help

The pastor emphasized that; “This collection is used for emergency help, e.g. paying utilities, rent, food and medicine for our people in South Austin who need temporary help. All persons needing this emergency help are referred to St. Ignatius because they have a Social Worker that tries to get financial assistance from other agencies first. We send our collection to St. Ignatius, where it is combined with their collection, for this emergency assistance” (223:30/07/1989) (223:13/12/1992).

In November 1990, the Sunday Bulletin appealed for men’s jackets, sweatshirts and socks and blankets and sleeping bags for the St. Vincent de Paul Stores. “The recent cold weather exhausted the supply.” The two thrift stores were located at 321 E. 2nd Street and 1500 S. Congress Avenue (223:18/11/1990). During 1991, the Southside store was moved to 1327 S. Congress Avenue and the store on E. 2nd Street was closed. Prior to Christmas in 1991, the SVDP Store at 1327 S. Congress Ave. offered free pictures with Santa Claus on Saturday December 14 (223:08/12/1991). The pastor occasionally reminded parishioners that the St. Vincent de Paul Store at 1327 S. Congress Avenue needed volunteers (223:16/08/1992).

In November 1991, the pastor and the Finance Council of San José Parish announced that the parish would give 10% of its income to the poor. The parish would begin tithing its income. The pastor, Rev. Underwood, explained that, “When I was pastor at Dolores Parish, we tithed as a parish (10% of our Sunday collections went to help the poor, two missions in Mexico, etc.).” He went on to say that, “As soon as the parish began tithing, our financial situation completely changed. Jesus really blessed us” (223:29/11/1992).

The Second Collection for St. Vincent de Paul continued after the parish began tithing and was sometimes reported in the Sunday Bulletin as a separate item. Often the amount of the Second Collection for St. Vincent de Paul was not reported. The pastor explained that, “Your contributions enable us to supplement St. Vincent de Paul fund at St. Ignatius to help our parishioners in crisis situation”. The Second Collection for SVDP was included in parish income (223: 31/01/1993) until May 9, 1993 when SVDP collection was once again reported as a separate item (223: 09/05/1993). It appears that the Second Collection was considered as income for the parish and the parish then sent 10% of its income to the joint San José-St. Ignatius SVDP Conference (223:07/03/1993).

Rev. Kirby D. Garner moved into the rectory on March 15, 1993 (223:07/03/1993) and was listed as the pastor in the Sunday Bulletin for the first time on April 25 (223:25/04/1993). Rev. Underwood, who had served as pastor for ten year, announced that he would be leaving on March 7 (223:04/04/1993). On May 2, 1993, the amount of the St. Vincent de Paul Collection was listed in the Weekly Financial Report for the first time since Feb. 14. Father Kirby had replaced Father Underwood and presumable the parish had stopped tithing. On the day that the parish stopped tithing, the second collection for St. Vincent de Paul was $2,098.00, double what it had been only five years before (223:09/05/1993).

In March 1993, the SVDP Store asked for donations of furniture and household goods. Merchandise in the store was low because of many calls for help. The pastor explained that the furniture should be in good condition since there are no volunteers to make repairs. The store could arrange for pick up (223: 07/03/1993).

In September 1993, the joint SVDP conference reported contributions of St. Ignatius Black Bag $4,925; San José Black Bag $1,812 and a donation from the SVDP District Council of $1,500 for a total contributions of $8,237. Expenditures were $8,110 to help 364 families (223:19/09/1993).

In contrast to the Vincentians at San José, the Vincentians at St. Ignatius were particularly active. Three of the sixteen Presidents of the Austin District Council prior to 1997 were from the St. Ignatius Conference. These three were C.A. Schutze, 1966-1968; Joe Juranek, 1980-1983 and Max Earl, 1989-1992) (272).

Much of the work of the parish Conferences consisted of home visits to individuals who asked for help. Fundraising was a necessary activity. San José relied on the monthly second collection for about two-thirds of its donations to the work of the Society. Other funds came from private donors and the collection of items to sell in the SVDP Thrift Store. Conferences were also scheduled to provide volunteers to work in the thrift store. The thrift store was located within the St. Ignatius Parish boundaries and Vincentians from St. Ignatius volunteered to work at the thrift store.

The Board of the Austin SVDP Store was reorganized in 1997 to give a seat to an appointee of the Bishop and to business leaders. The store continued to donate $5,000 monthly to both the Ladies of Charity and the District Council of Austin Society St. Vincent de Paul out of profits from the operation of the store on South Congress Avenue (272).

In 2016, the building at 1327 South Congress Ave. was sold and one-half of the proceeds were given the Ladies of Charity (Esther Barrientes). St. Vincent de Paul Diocesan Council received the other half and used the money to build a new store and office building on Braker Lane. The expense to make the transition from its location on South Congress Avenue proved to be more than anticipated and the Diocesan Council briefly endured a financial crisis. However, the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in its many facets continued and in 2016 a Conference of the Society was formed at San Jose to take up the work done so well for some many years by the Vicentians at St. Ignatius Church. At about the same time, the Conference at St. Ignatius stopped doing home visits. The Conference at San José agreed to make home visits to needy families living with the parish boundaries of both San José and St. Ignatius Parishes.

## Guadalupanas: Breakfast and meals

The Guadalupanas and the kitchen in the San Jose cafeteria and the San José Community Center were intimately acquainted with each other. The Guadalupanas served many meals to parishioners and guests alike. One of the first San José Sunday Bulletins carried a notice that, on December 11, 1960, the Guadalupanas served supper after the Solemn Blessing of the Statue of the Virgin Most Pure. The Guadalupanas donated the statue to the church (223:12/04/60).

The Guadalupanas and other women of the parish prepared meals for resident and visiting priests (223; 02/03/1986) and sold food to benefit needy parishioners. In March 1984, the Sunday bulletin announced a benefit dinner for José Rocha and John Riojas Sr. (223:11/03/84). The benefit dinner was sponsored by the Socios and the Guadalupanas and raised $476 for the medical bills of the two men (223:25/03/84). The Guadalupanas served prepared and served food and cleaned up after the Deacon Ordination in June 1991 (223:30/06/1991).

Occasionally, the Guadalupanas recognized the special relationship between the Guadalupanas and the Socios by hosting a meal for the Socios (223:01/14/68) (223:07/01/73) or for the Socias and their families (250:12/09/74) (223:26/10/75) but, more often, food was sold to other parishioners, specifically to raise money (223:03/20/66) (223:04/033/66) (223:08/06/75). Often the profits from the sale were for a specific purpose, such a church renovation project (223:13/07/75).

The Guadalupanas could not afford to offer the food for free so almost every meal was also a fundraiser. They sold dinner on Sundays after Mass (223:10/25/64) (223:11/01/64) and at public events, such as the groundbreaking ceremony and the blessing of the new school (12) (223:10/16/66). Sunday cake sales after Mass were frequent (223:10/16/66) (223:11/06/66) (223:01/26/70) (223:08/02/70) (223:07/06/1992). If tamales were left unsold from the Christmas season, they were sold as part of a breakfast menu (223:02/05/67) (223:02/19/67).

### Mañanitas

Sometime prior to 1976, the Guadalupanas began to serve cakes and cookies in the parish hall after the Mass following the singing of the Mañanitas on the morning of December 12. As early as 1967, they served snacks in conjunction with the December Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe (223:12/10/67). By 1983, the menu for the reception had become standardized and the Guadalupanas served sweet rolls, coffee and hot chocolate after the 6:00AM Mass of December 12 to all participants (223:11/12/83). Somewhat later, tamales were added to the menu.  

### Breakfast

From September until December 1970, the PTA served breakfast in the San José Community Center after the Sunday Mass. The program was not sustainable and was discontinued in 1971. In July 1974, the Guadalupanas again began serving breakfast in the Community Center after every 8:00AM and 10:00AM Mass. Breakfast cost $1.25 and consisted of beans, bacon or chorizo Mexicano, scrambled eggs, flour tortillas and coffee. Extra burritos were 35 cents each (249:14/07/74). They continued to serve breakfast until at least October 1974 (250:12/09/74) (250:20/10/74).

In October 1975, the parish created a new ministry, the Breakfast Couples, to continue the breakfast program (223:28/09/75) (209). The Guadalupanas helped with the breakfast program (223:07/03/76) (223:07/08/83) and, in 1990 and 1991, served breakfast on a rotating schedule with four other sodalities, sometimes teaming up with the Catholic War Veterans to do so (223:01/11/1992). The breakfast program continued, with many modifications, until 2018 when it was suspended. In 1988, lunch began to be sold outside of the parish hall after the breakfast program finished serving after the third Mass on Sundays (223:17/07/1988). This too continued until 2018.

### Bingo

San José Church began to sponsor bingo in the parish hall during World War Two. In 1945, the Bingo Chairmen were Joe Uriegas, Ramón De Leon and Peter Rivera. Snacks were sold during a break in the games. In 1945, a group of twelve Army brides called the San José Society sold snacks at the bingos. They sold coffee, pastries, popcorn and sodas and pork roast tacos for three for $1.00 (210).

In the early 1960s, the Socios ran bingo on Sunday nights two nights a month and the PTA sponsored bingo on Wednesdays. Sometimes the Socios hired a cook to prepare food during a break in the games (213). In September 1964, the Socias hosted a bingo on Sunday night when the hall was otherwise empty. They sold cards for 15 games for $1 (223:08/16/64). They sold hot dogs, raspa and cakes during the break. The funds were for the new church. The event netted $292 (223:09/27/64). Occasionally, the women of the parish had a special bingo on Wednesday or Friday nights in the hall cafeteria (probably to raise money for the May 5 bazaar or the Jamaica) (223:11/06/66) (223:03/10/68). In October 1968, a regular Friday bingo was added (213).

By 1970, the three bingo nights were the parish’s biggest source of income (213). Competition between the three bingo groups was intense and, to increase the income from their games, the Socios asked the Guadalupanas to manage the kitchen. The Guadalupanas helped by preparing and selling food during a break in the games. The Guadalupanas prepared complete meals in addition to snacks (223:19/10/75). The games were stopped in October 1977 after a lawyer named Madalyn Murray O’Hair complained about them (251).

After bingo became legal in Texas again after 1984, the Guadalupanas helped by serving the bingo dinner two or three times a year (233). They also sold take-out plates as part of their annual tamalada (233:05/18/14).

### 50th Anniversary

The Guadalupanas were always ready to cooperate with the pastor when asked. In March 1989, the Guadalupanas (Becky Reyna and María Galvan) agreed to serve a potluck dinner to 1,500 persons after the August 27, 1989 50th Anniversary Mass (242). On July 26 plans for the potluck dinner were abandoned because of lack of seating capacity. The Guadalupanas then agreed to serve cake and punch in the hall to 1,000 people, mostly guests from outside the parish (242).

### Take-out

Beginning in about 2009, the Guadalupanas began to sell fried fish on Holy Friday (223). From 2012 through 2018, they sold either fish or enchilada and nopalito plates with rice and beans on Holy Friday for $6 per plate (233) (233:02/01/14).

## Guadalupanas: Donations and Gifts

A primary focus of the Guadalupanas has always been to raise money for the church although they are a pious association or sodality. According to Mrs. Amelia (Molly) Resas, when Rev. Mendez requested help to raise money for the church, she and the ladies of the church community began having “reunions”, today known as Jamaicas. The “reunions” were day-long events of family-oriented activities and fellowship, to raise funds for the new church. After the first church was built, Mrs. Resas formed the Guadalupanas and invited the ladies of the new parish to join the Society (229).

According to Rev. Houser, when, in 1954, the decision was made to build a larger church, he knew that the cost would be fiestas and more fiestas. That was the way the people of San José raised money for many years. In the center of all such activities were the two Sodalities of women and men, Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (las Guadalupanas) and Sagrado Corazón of Jesús (los Socios) (211).

### 1961

The first mention of the Guadalupanas in the Sunday Bulletin was an advertisement for, “Tamales by the Guadalupanas for our new statue of San José”. This meant that the Guadalupanas sold tamales to raise funds for the new statue (223:03/19/61) (223:04/16/61). A few months later, the Guadalupanas again sold tamales to help the parish purchased a freezer for the school cafeteria (223:10/22/61) (223:11/19/61).

### 1962

The next year, 1962, the Guadalupanas volunteered to provide food for the Hispanic Convention prior to Easter (223:01/21/62). They sold tamales to raise the money needed to purchase the food for the Convention (223:02/18/62).

### 1963

The stated purpose of the Guadalupanas is to honor the Mother of God under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe (223:07/14/63). December 12, the Feast of the Lady of Guadalupe, is the high point of the year for the Guadalupanas and they always celebrate it. In 1962, the Guadalupanas decided to sponsor a pilgrimage to Mexico City in December (223:10/07/62). Many of the 23 Socias who made the trip could not afford the round trip bus fare of $31.86 each (223:11/18/62) so they held a bingo to raise funds (223:10/21/62). The profits from the bingo games were used to subsidize the cost of the pilgrimage.

### 1964

Usually, any funds raised were given, either directly or indirectly, to the church. The Guadalupanas sponsored bingo games in September 1964. The $292 realized from the bingo and related food sales went into the church building fund (223:08/16/64) (223:09/27/64). A few months later, they again sold tamales and raised enough money to purchase an organ for the church (223:12/06/64) (223:12/20/64) (223:12/27/64) (223:01/10/65).

### 1965

In 1965, the Guadalupanas sponsored two large fiestas, on May 2 and October 24. The May 2 event was the church fair (sometimes called a Concurso) that took place indoors, usually at the City Auditorium. This event was usually called the Bazaar and was an annual parish-wide celebration during the 1950s and 1960s. The Guadalupanas sponsored the event in 1965 and probably other years (223:04/18/65). The fiesta raised $923 for the new church (223:05/16/65) (223:05/23/65). The second event was held outdoors on Sunday, October 24 and raised $455 for the school (223:09/26/65) (223:10/03/65) (223:10/17/65) (223:10/31/65). In later years, the fall event was called the Jamaica. The next month, the Guadalupanas sponsored a fiesta at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new school (12).

### 1966

The Sunday Bulletin listed a number of fundraising events sponsored by the Guadalupanas between 1966 and 1969. In January 1966, they earned $168 for the school at a film screening (223:02/20/66) (223:03/20/66). In March, they sold food in the parish hall and raised $232.40 (223:03/20/66) (223:04/033/66). The money was used to purchase a new statue of the Virgin Mary for the school (223:04/24/66) (223:05/01/66).

In September 1966, they paid for the furniture in the Meeting Room of the school (223:09/11/66) and donated an additional $500 to the school. On September 4, 1966, an announcement in the Sunday Bulletin said that, “Any Individual or Group who donates $500.00 for a school room will have a plaque put on the door of that room” (223:09/04/66). The Guadalupanas donated $500 and a classroom was named the Guadalupana Room as a memorial to their generosity.

### 1967

In the spring of 1967, the Guadalupanas raised $2,823 at the Concurso and $370 from a party on July 2. The money was given to the church office (223:07/09/67). In October, the Guadalupanas sponsored an all-day fiesta (223:10/08/67) with barbecue and bingo at 8:00PM with twenty prizes and $100 cash on the final card (223:10/29/67). The proceeds of $717.10 were given to the parish (223:11/05/67). During 1967, income from bazaars and fiestas was $6,802 and the Guadalupanas donated $3,000 to the school fund. The Guadalupanas raised most of the money the church received from the church bazaar in 1968 (223:01/21/68).

### 1968

Sometimes, the money raised was spent immediately. In July 1968, the Guadalupanas raised $53.55 at a bake sale (223:07/07/68). They gave $25 to Randy Garcia, $25 to David Reyna and $3.55 to buy flowers for the altar of our Lady (223:07/21/68). In September, they sold tamales in the parish hall from 10:00PM to 3:00PM to, according to the pastor, “help us with some of the bills” (223:10/20/68). After they raised $67 from party games on Thanksgiving 1968, they gave $37 to Rev. Mikan and $30 to Rev. Haley (223:12/01/68).

### 1969

In July 1969, the Pastor reported to the Parish Council that the Guadalupanas had set aside $2,000 to remodel the sacristy. He said they wanted to rework a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe to realign the picture so its corner matched that of La Virgen de San Juán (213). The Guadalupanas also spent money on the kitchen in the San José Community Center. They purchased a new stove for the Community Center for $570 (213). In November 1969, they purchased about $1,000 in kitchen supplies for the new parish hall (213).

### 1971

Often the Guadalupanas funded projects at the request of the pastor. In January 1971, they donated $870.00 for renovations to the rectory kitchen and to replace rugs in the rectory. They were also paid $538 for the new cabinets in the sacristy (223:01/31/71). In July, they (and several other parish organizations) donated $500 each to purchase a new station wagon for the use of the parish (223:07/11/71) (223: 13/02/72).

On July 25, 1971, the Guadalupanas had a Jamaica to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their organization (223:07/25/71) (223:07/18/71). The Jamaica raised $2,161.06 in total. The Queen candidates alone raised $1,748.22; the Bingo games raised $65.00 and food sales raised $347.84 (223: 08/01/71). Most of the money was used to install a cry room and kneelers in the church (223: 23/04/72) (223: 25/03/73).

### 1974

Sometimes the sums involved were small. In August 1974, the Guadalupanas donated food for a benefit dance for Julius Segura (249: 21/07/74). The next year, they donated a quilt for the church bazaar that was raffled for $121 (223:18/05/75). The Guadalupanas sold Mexican dinners from 11AM to 2PM for $1.50 in June 1975 (223:08/06/75) and provided flowers for the blessing of the renovated church in August 1975 (223:31/08/75). As a rule, if they had money, they gave it to the church. They donated $3,000 for the church renovation project (223:13/07/75). That left them without funds and, when they cooked supper for the Bingo games in October 1975, they appealed for donations of cake mixes, dry beans, rice, coffee, sugar and cheese (223:19/10/75).

### 1976

Sometime after 1971, the Jamaica in the fall of the year became an annual event sponsored by the parish, instead of by the Guadalupanas or the Socios (209). The Guadalupanas continued to participate by sponsoring one or two booths. The profit from the booths was income for the church. The booths sponsored by the Guadalupanas had total sales of $93 in 1978 (223:19/11/78). Prior to 1983, the Bazaar, in the spring of the year, was the larger of the two events. In 1976, the two booths run by the Guadalupanas at the Bazaar had total sales of $222 (223:09/05/76).

### 1979

In 1979, the organ purchased by the Guadalupanas in 1964, was worn out and the Guadalupanas purchased a new organ for the church. It cost $2,395. The pastor commented, “This was not the first organ the church had but it was fancier” (223:01/04/79).

### 1983

In February 1983, the Guadalupanas raised enough money from cake sales and other fund raisers (223:13/02/83) to donate $1,015 to pay for painting the second floor, the stairways and exterior doors of the school (223:27/02/83). They donated flowers for the altar on Mother’s Day (223:15/05/83) and, in November, donated $3,000 to help pay for the rug in the renovated church (223:11/12/83). The Guadalupanas also participated in the parish breakfast program by serving breakfast and dinner in the San José Community Center after Sunday Mass (223:07/08/83).

### 1984

In March 1984, the Sunday Bulletin announced a benefit dinner for José Rocha and John Riojas Sr. (223:11/03/84). The benefit dinner was sponsored by the Socios and the Guadalupanas and raised $476 for the medical bills of the two men (223:25/03/84).Both men were members of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

### 1985

The gross sales from the tamales made and sold at the 1986 Fall Fiesta by the Guadalupanas were $2,999.50. Unlike other booth operators, the Guadalupanas donated everything so the net profit was also $2,999.50. The previous year the net profit was $2,076.95 (223: 06/10/1985). The annual Jamaica became the largest single fundraising event for the Guadalupanas and the parish (233). The Guadalupanas donated the ingredients for the tamales and donated the gross sales to the church without discounting for expenses (223:02/08/1987). This model was later adopted by the Jamaica Committee and applied to all the sponsored booths at the annual Jamaica.

### 1989

The Guadalupanas agreed to serve a potluck dinner to 1,500 persons after the August 27, 1989 50th Anniversary Mass (242). On July 26 plans for the potluck dinner were abandoned because of lack of seating capacity. The Guadalupanas then agreed to serve cake and punch in the parish hall to 1,000 people, mostly guests from outside the parish (242).

### 1990

On Thanksgiving Day, the Guadalupanas served a complete turkey dinner with all the trimmings after the last three Sunday Masses as part of the parish breakfast program (223:18/11/1990) (223:25/11/1990).

In 2015, the annual budget of the Guadalupanas was $6,800 (233). Most of this money was spent either directly or indirectly to support the work of the parish. The Guadalupanas continued their long tradition as the largest women’s sodality in the parish and the most prolific source of donations to the parish. They continue to work closely with the pastor in all of their projects. For many years, Father John Boyko was their spiritual adviser. In 2017 and 2018, the pastor, Rev. Alberto Borruel continued in that role and attended most of the Society’s monthly meetings.

## Guadalupanas, Fiestas

According to Mrs. Amelia (Molly) Resas, la Sociedad Guadalupana at San José Church was formed when Rev. Mendez requested help to raise money for a church. She knew that the prospective parishioners, the Mexicans of South Austin, while personally generous and devoted to the Catholic Church, were, in general, short of funds. She understood too that they were an isolated community, set apart from White society by the rules and norms of racial segregation and a language barrier. In response to the request of Fr. Mendez, the Mexican ladies in South Austin began hosting “reunions”, today known as Jamaicas. The “reunions” or fiestas were day-long events of family-oriented activities and fellowship, organized around food. In the Mexican tradition, the fiestas could be used to raise funds for the new church (209) (229).

### 1940-1941

When the first church on W. Mary Street opened for services in June 1940, “there was a huge Jamaica. Everyone came from all around to attend the opening of the new church” (221). The event was more than just the opening of the new building. It was one of the first San José Jamaicas. Eight months later, on Sunday, May 4, 1941, El Comite de Festividades de La Mision de San José invited the colonia Mexicana to another event on the church grounds. All four sodalities of the mission, la Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón (then called la Sociedad de los Senores), the Guadalupanas (then called la Sociedad del Corazón de María), the young women (called la Sociedad de Hijas de María) and young men (Juventud Católica) each had their assigned roles. The ladies of women’s society were in charge of preparing the food and their daughters with serving it (Photo066).

The young people of the congregation, with the help of seven students from St. Edward’s University, kept the crowd entertained from 7:30PM until about 10:30PM on Sunday night, May 4, 1941 (Photo066). In later years, a group of twelve young women, whose husbands were soldiers who were stationed overseas, formed their own solidarity group and they sponsored the entertainment for the Jamaicas. Fr. Mendez called them, the San José Society. One of the women said, “We had excellent talent among the parish members” (210).

### 1950-1958

The spring fundraising event, usually scheduled in May, evolved into the church’s most important fundraising event of the year. It was usually called the Bazaar. From the middle 1950s until the 1980s, a formal dinner, the crowning of a queen and on-stage entertainment was the central focus of the fiesta. Young men and women vied for the honor to be the Queen or King of the festival by raising money for the parish.

When the decision was made to build a larger church in 1954, the pastor commented that, “The cost would be fiestas and more fiestas”. That was the way the people of San José raised money. In the center of all such activities were the two sodalities of women and men: Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (las Guadalupanas) and Sagrado Corazón of Jesús (los Socios) (211).

Two documents in the Catholic Archives of Texas describe festivals sponsored by San José Church and held in the City Auditorium. One event took place in the fall of the year and the other in the spring. The first describes a “Fiesta Patria” that took place on September 18 sometime between 1950 and 1958. The men mentioned in the program were Socios. The Guadalupanas likely prepared the tamales and other food served at the event (33). The event commemorated the Mexican Independence Day on September16.

The second document describes a “Regio Festival” held on February 19, 1955 in the City Auditorium. The festival was sponsored by the missions of San José in Austin and Santa Cruz in Buda. The program began with the reception and crowning of the Queen, Ms. Frances Gallardo, by Rev. Louis J. Reicher, the Bishop of Austin. After the crowning of the Queen, the program continued with a dance and then a dinner. The program ended with an on-stage show of songs and dances directed by Mrs. Nellie Garcia. Mrs. Beatríz Calderón, a long-time President of the Guadalupanas, was in charge of the food (34).  

### 1960

Few written records exist about activities at San José Church prior to December 1960 when the first Sunday Bulletin appeared. The first mention of a fiesta sponsored by the Guadalupanas was a Jamaica to coincide with Diocesan Spanish Convention in April 1962. The fiesta centered around the coronation of King Frank López, Queen Jesusa Sánchez, Prince Ronald Dillard, Princess Marie Lawler, Duchess Dolores Diaz and Marquesa Virginia Soliz (223:04/29/62).

### 1965

In 1965, the Guadalupanas organized two large fiestas, one on May 2 and another on October 24. The first fiesta began in March when four young ladies announced their candidacy for the role of Queen of the Festival (223:03/07/65). The winner was apparently chosen at a fiesta on April 22 (223:04/18/65). All San José parishioners were invited to a program on May 2, called a Concurso, probably at the City Auditorium. Booths sold snow cones, sodas and cakes. Supper (75 cents for fried chicken, rice, potato salad and tea) was served at 5:00PM followed by a drawing at 8:00PM. Immediately following the drawing, the Queen was crowned and a program of entertainment began (223:05/02/65) (62). The fiesta raised $923 for the church building fund (223:05/16/65) (223:05/23/65).

The second event was on Sunday, October 24, 1965 and coincided with the groundbreaking ceremony for the new school (12). This event was called the Fiesta of the Guadalupanas. The program began a 5:00PM when supper (costing 75 cents per plate) was served. Party games (bingo) began at 8:00PM (223:09/26/65). The event raised $455 for the San José School (223:10/17/65) (223:10/31/65). Fr. Houser commented, “Help these great workers”(223:10/03/65).                                                                    
### 1966-1967

In 1966 and 1967, the Fiesta of the Guadalupanas took place in July. In 1966, the fiesta began at 4:00PM with a barbecue chicken dinner and ended at 9:00PM with a drawing for raffle prizes. Booths sold food (tacos, hamburgers, menudo, raspa) or offered games (White House, fishpond, watermelons, cake walk, darts, bingo) (223:07/10/66). The Guadalupanas brought in $347 from their Jamaica in 1966 (223:08/28/66).

The event on July 2, 1967 was called a Reinado. Six candidates for the role of Queen competed (223:04/23/67). The queen (Rita Ramirez) was crowned during the Farewell Program for Fr. Houser. $2,453.05 was collected on the votes for the Queen (223:07/02/67). The Guadalupanas turned in $370 as proceeds from the July 2 party in addition to the $2,823 from the Concurso (223:07/09/67).

Four months later, the Guadalupanas sponsored a fiesta on October 29 (223:10/08/67).  The event was an all-day barbecue ending with a bingo at 8:00PM. The bingo games had twenty prizes and $100 cash on the final card (223:10/29/67). The proceeds of $717.10 were given to the parish (223:11/05/67). During 1967, the church’s income from bazaars and fiestas was $6,802. $3,000 of that was money that the Guadalupana’s donated to the school (223:01/21/68).

### 1968-1969

Between 1968 and 1983, the parish sponsored at least two annual events. One event was always indoors and took place during the spring of the year, usually in May. The other took place later in the year with the dates ranging from July to October. Often both events were called Bazaars but gradually the spring event became known as the Bazaar and the fall event became known as the Jamaica. The Guadalupanas supported the bazaar even if they did not organize them. The Society sponsored five booths at the July 28, 1968 Parish Bazaar (piñata, apron booth, doll booth, country store booth, food) (223:07/21/68). On May 4, 1969, the Guadalupanas sponsored three booths at the church bazaar at the City Auditorium (country store, clothes, flowers) (223:04/27/69) (213).

### 1971-1975

On Sunday July 25, 1971, the Guadalupans organized a Jamaica to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their organization (223:07/18/71) (223:07/25/71). The event was a concurso in which four young ladies competed for the title of Queen (223:06/20/71). The Jamaica raised $2,161.06. Of that, the Queen candidates raised $1,748.22. The profits from a Bingo was $65.00 and the profits from food sales were $347.84 (223: 08/01/71).

In 1972, the Guadalupanas had three booths at the annual parish bazaar in May and earned  $150 (223: 21/05/72). They sold dinner at the annual bazaar in 1973 for a profit of $449.00 (223: 01/07/73). The bazaar was an expensive undertaking and required some upfront money. In 1975, when Sophia de Hoyos was president (223:27/04/75), the Guadalupanas sold tamales and donated $110.00 to the bazaar committee as start-up money. They also quilted and raffled a quilt for a profit of $121.00 (223:18/05/75).

### 1976-1982

The Guadalupanas had two booths at the May 2, 1976 bazaar (gifts and plants and cherry tree) (223:02/05/76). The two booths run by the Guadalupanas had total sales of $222 (223:09/05/76). A tamale plate was sold but not by the Guadalupanas. Prior to 1982, the Guadalupanas did not sell tamales at either the spring or fall events. They had a booth at the Fall Fiesta in November 1978 and sold $93.15 (223:19/11/78). The next spring, the Guadalupanas and the Socios sponsored Sandra Polanco to be the Queen of the May Bazaar (223:01/04/79). It was not until September 1982 that the Guadalupanas began to sell tamales at the annual Jamaicas. In 1982, they sponsored two booths at the Fall Fiesta: Country Store and Tamales (223:19/09/82). The sales of Country Store was $94 and the tamales $273. In terms of sales, tamale booth ranked seventh out of 38 booths (223:31/10/82).

### 1984-1988

By 1984, the sale of tamales had become the major source of the money raised by the Guadalupanas at the Fall Fiestas. In 1984, the net profit from the sale of tamales at the annual Jamaica was $2,076.95 (223:06/10/1985). In July, 1985, the Guadalupanas asked anyone who would like to help make tamales for the Fall Fiesta to meet at the Community Center every Wednesday at 6:00PM (223:14/07/1985). This announcement was in the Sunday Bulletin for about three weeks. The Guadalupanas made the tamales by hand just as they did at home and needed many hands to make the tamales. The gross sales from tamales at the Fall Fiesta of 1985 were $2,999.50 (223: 06/10/1985).

For several years thereafter, the Guadalupanas invited ladies of the parish to help make tamales. In 1987, the volunteers were asked to meet at 3:00PM on Wednesday, October 28, in the parish hall (223:25/10/1987). In 1988, volunteers were encouraged to leave their names and telephone numbers at the church office (223:24/07/1988). The Guadalupanas also appealed for donations. In August 1987, the pastor thanked those who donated ingredients for tamales as well as those who made them (223:02/08/1987)              

### 1989-2009

The Guadalupanas continued to sponsor booths at the annual Jamaica. In 2009, they had five booths at the Jamaica: tamales ($3,803 in sales), funnel cakes ($1,650), plants ($612), Country Store ($273) and aguas frescas ($315). In 2009, their total sales were $6,654.50 (233). In the 2008 tamalada, the Guadalupanas made 640 dozen tamales. They sold 44 dozen, ate 21 dozen, gifted 12 dozen to the church staff and set aside 17 dozen for a Bingo Dinner they had committed to serve. This left 546 dozen to sell at the Jamaica (233). In recent years, the goal was to prepare enough tamales to have 500 dozen to sell at the Jamaica and 75 dozen for sale elsewhere (233).

## Guadalupanas: Las Mañanitas

The Sociedad Guadalupana, known as the Guadalupanas, was formed at San Jose Church in 1941 (229). The organization’s name was derived from that of Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, the patroness of the Americas. The purpose of the society was, “to share our gifts and talents with the San Jose Community and demonstrate our praise and thanksgiving for the love and salvation of Our Lord Jesus Christ and His Mother, Our Lady of Guadalupe” (Mission Statement, January 2009).

“One of the most important events for the Sociedad Guadalupana is the annual memorial celebration of the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. The Socias dress Our Lady with roses and prepare her altar to accept the roses presented to her by parishioners on her day. All members participate in a pre-Mass celebration with songs of praise to Our Lady. After Mass, the Socias host a reception of tamales, pan dulce and hot chocolate for those attending the mañanitas” (Mission Statement, January 2009).

For many years, the Guadalupanas met together for corporate communion once a month on the second Sunday of each month or the Sunday that fell nearest the 12th of the month. The Mass was followed by a prayer service honoring Our Lady of Guadalupe and then a monthly meeting (209). The Socios of the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón always met on the first Sunday of each month and, in recent years, the Guadalupanas too frequently celebrate their corporate Mass on the first Sunday of the month, instead of on the second Sunday.

The first mention of the mañanitas in the Sunday Bulletin was that of December 10, 1961 when it was announced that the 8:00AM Mass in honor of our Lady of Guadalupe was sponsored by the Guadalupanas (223:12/10/61). There was no mention of a song service prior to the Mass or a reception after the Mass.

In 1962, the Guadalupanas organized a pilgrimage to Mexico in December (223:10/07/62). The pilgrims left Sunday morning, December 9 and returned Saturday afternoon, December 16. The pilgrims were in Mexico City on December 10-13. The pilgrims from San José stayed in the Madero Hotel, which was four blocks from the Basilica (223:11/25/62). This allowed them to attend the mañanitas service at the Basilica on the morning of December 12. Most of those who made the trip were Socias (members of the Society of Guadaulapanas) (223:11/18/62). There was no mention of the mañanitas at San José that year.

In 1963, another large group of Guadalupanas made the pilgrimage to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico (223:12/01/63). The schedule was similar to that of the previous year, leaving Austin on Sunday December 8 and returning on Saturday December 15 (223:12/08/63). However, in 1963, those Socias and Socios who did not make the pilgrimage to Mexico, organized a song service for the mañanitas on Thursday, December 12, at 5:30AM, followed by Mass at 6:15AM. That night, there was a procession and Rosary at 7:30PM to mark the event (223:12/22/63).

The pilgrimage to Mexico City became an annual event after 1963 and continued until 1980 or 1981. After 1981, the pilgrimages to Mexico City continued but under the auspicious of private tour companies. The exception was 1967 when the Guadalupanas decided to forego the annual trip to Mexico. Instead, Rev. Daniel Villanueva conducted a three-day mission on Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 10, 11 and 12 (223:12/03/67). This was in lieu of the annual trip to Mexico City (223:11/26/67). This was a special program for Our Lady of Guadalupe. The schedule was: Sunday-Rosary, Sermon and Benediction at 7:00PM; Monday- 6:15AM Mass and Sermon, 6:30PM practice singing hymns of our Lady; 7:00PM Rosary, Sermon and Benediction; Tuesday- 6:15AM Mass and sermon; 7:00PM Rosary, Sermon and Benediction; 8:00PM Parish social in Hall with cakes and cookies served by the Guadalupanas (223:12/10/67).

Beginning in 1963, singing the mañanitas on the morning of December 12 became an established tradition at San José Church. The song service began at 5:30AM or 6:00AM and was followed by Mass at 6:00AM or 6:30AM (223:05/12/71) (223:10/12/72) (250:08/12/74). In 1974, a professional company of actors from San Antonio presented a drama called The Miracle of Tepeyac on Dec. 12, 7:30PM in the parish hall. Ballet Infantil of Austin, San Jose Choir and Folk Group from St. Ignatius were also on the program. The program was in Spanish with English narration. Tickets were $2 for adults and $1 for children (250: 08/12/74).

Sometime prior to 1978, the Guadalupanas began to host a reception after the sunrise song service and morning Mass. In 1978, the mañanitas began at 5:30AM followed by Mass at 6:00AM and with a breakfast of sweet bread, chocolate and coffee served after the Mass. At 7:00PM in the evening, there was a procession followed by Mass and a potluck dinner (una comida de plato cubierto) in the parish hall (223:03/12/78). Rey Cortes and the 12AM Choir led the singing at 5:30AM and the Guadalupanas served the food after Mass. The 8:00AM choir sang at the evening Mass. The group Azatlán del Sur (with Mrs. Limón) danced at the evening Mass and at the dinner. The Guadalupanas served the dinner as well as breakfast (223:17/12/78).

In 1981, 1982 and 1983, when December 12 fell on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday respectively, the Diocese of Austin sponsored a city-wide celebration of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Sunday at the Municipal Auditorium (223: 25/10/1981). The diocesan celebration began at 1:30PM in the Coliseum with a procession. Each organization was asked to carry their banners in the procession. Archbishop Patricio Flores presided at Mass at 3:00PM. San Jose provided the choir, directed by Rey Cortes, and the ushers, directed by Sam Guerra (223: 06/12/1981).  The pastor said, “Let’s have the whole city of Austin see our unity as a community of Faith and our devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe” (223: 13/12/1981).

The celebration at the Municipal Auditorium did not seem to diminish the mañanitas at San José Church. Since December 12 fell on a Saturday, the pastor called a meeting of parish organizations and prayer groups to plan a longer than usual program for the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe (223: 15/11/1981). That year the mañanitas began at 6:30AM with the Mass at 7:30AM. The Guadalupanas served hot chocolate, coffee and pan dulce after Mass. The program included Children’s CCD Mass at 10:00AM on Sunday and a procession, evening Mass then covered dish dinner at 7:00PM on Sunday (223: 22/11/1981). Sister María Navarro organized the event (223: 20/12/1981).

In 1982, there was an attempt to establish the tradition of El Triduo Guadalupano. El Triduo consisted of a service on December 10, a procession and Mass on December 11 and mañanitas followed by Mass and hot chocolate on December 12 (223:05/12/82). In 1982, there was also an event at the City Coliseum for the Virgen of Guadalupe.

In December 1983, the Diocese sponsored a Mass on Sunday at the City Coliseum with choirs and ministers from the six Spanish speaking parishes in Austin. Groups were encouraged to take their banners. At San Jose, Mass followed the mañanitas on Monday morning from 5:00AM to 6:00AM. After Mass, the Guadalupanas served sweet rolls, coffee and hot chocolate in the Community Center (223:11/12/83). Following 7:00PM Mass on Monday, songs and poems were recited followed by a presentation by Ballet Folklorico Infantil of Austin. The Guadalupanas served coffee, punch and sweet bread (223:11/12/83). The Guadalupanas also decorated the Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine (223:18/12/83).

In December 12, 1984, which fell on a Wednesday, the program for the mañanitas was the same as the previous year when December 12 fell on a Monday, i.e. 5:00-6:00AM mañanitas; 6:00AM Mass followed by sweet rolls, coffee and hot chocolate in the Center after Mass; 7:00PM Mass followed by entertainment and refreshments in the Center after Mass (223:09/12/84). Prior to 1992, tamales were added to the menu (223:06/12/1992). The program continued with minor changes until 2009 except that, in 2009, the Guadalupanas gathered in the grotto to say the Rosary at 4:00PM (233).

In 2014, the Guadalupanas began to sponsor forty-six daily Rosaries beginning on October 28 and continuing until December 12. Each Rosary was given a name, such as Humble Star, based on the forty-six stars depicted on the cloak worn by the Virgin of Guadalupe on the tilma in Mexico City. This was an old tradition that was introduced to San José by Father John Boyko in 2014. The group met at the grotto on Monday to Friday at 4:00PM, in the main church on Saturday and Sunday at 4:00PM or in houses by invitation in evening to say the Rosary (233:10/12/14). The introduction of the forty-six daily Rosaries did not change the other parts of the mañanitas program including the reception after the Mass on December 12 (233). In 2018, the Guadalupanas continued with their program of the forty-six Rosaries.

## Guadalupanas: Corporate Mass and Meetings

During the 1950s, most fraternal organizations whose membership consisted of San José parishioners attended mass and received Communion together monthly or quarterly. Such an event is called corporate Communion or corporate Mass. Corporate Communion and Mass was an opportunity for the members to sit and pray together in a show of unity and fraternity. The Knights of Columbus, who attend a corporate Mass once every three months, consider the Corporate Communion to be a “powerful sign of our fraternal solidarity” (Holy Spirit Catholic Church, Manhattan, Kansas website).

In 1960, the Guadalupanas, the Catholic War Veterans and the Parent Teacher Association each received Communion as a group on the 2nd Sunday of the month but at different Mass times (223:12/04/60). The corporate Mass of the Guadalupanas was at 8:00AM (223:09/13/70). The men’s organization, the Socios of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, attended Mass as a group at 8:00AM on the first Sunday of each month because the Constitution of the Socios stipulates that their corporate Mass be on the first Sunday of each month. The Guadalupanas celebrated their corporate Mass on the second Sunday of each month because that Sunday fell nearest the 12th of the month. The 12th day of the month is important to the Guadalupas because the miracle of the tilma took place on the 12th of December, 1531 (209). The contingent of Guadalupanas was so large (between fifty and one hundred women) (223:11/22/64) (223:09/11/66) that the event was referred to as Guadalupana Sunday (223:09/13/70).

Between 1961 and 1969, the monthly meetings of the Guadalupanas were at 2:00PM (223:01/08/61) (223:02/12/61) (223:07/09/61) (223:11/12/61) on the same day as their corporate Mass (223:09/13/70). They met in either the parish hall or the San José School (223:03/12/64). This allowed the Socias to eat breakfast after the 8:00AM Mass (223:01/14/68).  In July 1969, the meeting time was changed and the meeting began immediately after the monthly Communion Mass at 8:00AM (223:07/06/69) (223:09/07/69) (223:10/05/69). This may reflect a change in Canon Law that no longer required the faithful to fast from midnight before receiving the Holy Eucharist (Canon 919).

However, the new arrangement did not suit everyone and, by January 1972, the Mass and meeting schedule had returned what it had traditionally been, i.e. the Guadalupanas met at 2:00PM for their monthly meetings (223:16/01/72) (223:06/02/72). By March, that decision had been reversed and thereafter the meetings take place on Guadalupana Sunday beginning at 9:00AM immediately after the 8:00AM Mass (223:12/03/72) (223:07/01/73).

However, the schedule was not inflexible and sometimes the Mass was on the 2nd Sunday and the meeting was on the following Sunday immediately after the 8:00AM Mass (223:11/08/70). Occasionally the meeting was at the priest’s house (223:09/13/70) and occasionally special meetings were called (223:11/16/69). The Guadalupanas met monthly although, in 1981, they may have suspended their meetings during the summer months (223:30/08/1981).                        

Usually, officers for the coming year were elected at the November meeting (223:11/12/67) (223: 12/11/72) and announced to the parish community in December (223:12/03/67). The new officers were installed at the January meeting (223:01/14/68) (223:16/04/72).

The officers usually consisted of a president, a vice president, a secretary, a treasurer, a pro secretary and a pro treasurer (223:11/21/65). Other officials were overseers/celadores and standard bearers/porta-estandartes  (223:03/07/65). In 1964, when there were eighty Socias and fifty women attended the monthly meetings, there were four celadores  (223:03/07/65). The role of the overseer/celador is to communicate with the members on a monthly basis and to inform the Society of their health and wellbeing. The standard bearer/porta-estandarte carries the banner of the Society in processions and meetings. The Guadalupanas rotate the office of standard bearer/porta-estandarte on a monthly basis.

In March 1973, the Guadalupanas and the Socios had their monthly Mass at the same time at 8:00AM on April 1 (223: 25/03/73). However, for the next three years, the Guadalupanas continued to meet on the 2nd Sunday of each month while their husbands, the Socios, met on the 1st Sunday of each month. Finally, in March 1976, the Guadalupanas announced that the Guadalupana corporate Mass would take place on the first Sunday of each month (223:07/03/76). By October 1978, the change was made permanent (223:30/10/78). They attended corporate Mass alongside the Socios on the first Sunday of the month and met at 9:00AM or 9:30AM immediately following the monthly corporate Mass (223:28/01/79) (223:25/02/79). The Socios continued with their old meeting schedule and met at 11:00AM (223: April 1979 Calendar). The two Societies, the Guadalupanas and the Socios, occasionally met together. In the early 1980s, incoming officers were installed at a ceremony in the Parish Hall and the two societies met jointly for this (223:26/12/82).

In September 1966, the Society enrolled over 100 members for the first time (223:09/11/66). The Guadalupana Society was, for many years, the largest sodality at San José. Typically about one-half of the membership was active in the group’s functions. In 2013, the Guadalupanas reported 53 active members, 61 inactive members and 69 deceased members (233).

In 2014, the Society revised its rules and announced that dues paying members receive the following on their death: the right to wear the society’s insignia (medalla), the right to display the society’s banner at their Rosary and funeral and the expectation that the members of the Society will attend the Rosary and funeral. The dues were set at $5.00 per year (233:03/02/14). The Society continues to be the most active service organization at San José.

The officers serve two-year terms with elections in odd numbered years (233). Often the President will be returned to office for a number of years but the other officers rotate on a regular basis, giving the Society a number of individuals who will eventually take their turn as the President. In 2014, there were nine officers and five celadoras/overseers. The list of persons who carry the banner (porta estandarte) and present a bouquet to the Virgin (bouquet presenters) are scheduled a year in advance (233).

## Guadalupanas: Tamaladas

Tamaladas are gatherings at which tamales are assembled. Tamaladas usually take place in preparation for Christmas holiday meals at which tamales are traditionally served as the main dish. In Central Texas, tamaladas are a Mexican cultural tradition. The Guadalupanas of San José have a long tradition of preparing and selling tamales as a fundraiser. The first mention of a tamalada in the San José Sunday Bulletin was in March 19, 1961, when the Bulletin announced, “Tamales by the Guadalupanas for our new statue of San José”. This meant the Guadalupanas were selling tamales to raise funds for a new statue of the patron saint of the parish, Saint Joseph (223:03/19/61).

A month later, the Guadalupanas sold tamales to raise money to purchase insignias for themselves and to help pay for the statue. They made $42.69 and planned a second sale on the next Saturday (223:04/16/61). In the fall, the pastor, Rev. Joseph Houser, announced that, “the Guadalupanas would have a tamalada on Saturday to help us buy a deep freeze for the (school) cafeteria” (223:10/22/61). Subsequently, the Guadalupanas contributed $53 towards the purchase of a freezer for the cafeteria (223:11/19/61).

When the parish hosted the annual Hispanic convention (Convencion de las Asociaciones Parroquiales de Habla-Espanol) in 1962, the Guadalupanas prepared meals for the delegates. They raised the necessary funds by selling tamales on the weekends prior to the event (223:01/21/62). The tamales were prepared at home by the Guadalupanas and picked-up by the purchasers at the parish hall (223:02/18/62).

Income from the sale of tamales was not large. A typical sale in the early 1960s might make between $25 and $50 profit (223:02/18/62) (223:10/06/63) despite the enthusiastic backing of the pastor who commented, “The tamales made by them are always very tasty” (223:09/22/63). Two years later, a tamalada might result in a profit of from $80 to $100 (223:02/16/64) (223:03/29/64) (223:12/06/64). The Guadalupanas learned that hot, prepared meals were more profitable than the sale of tamales alone, presumably because most women made tamales at home for their families (223:10/25/64) (223:11/01/64).

The Guadalupanas listened carefully to the pastor when planning their activities. In early December 1964, the pastor asked the Guadalupanas to inquire about the possible purchase of an organ for the church (223:12/06/64). Before the end of the month, the Guadalupanas had raised enough money to present the church with a new organ (223:12/20/64). The new organ was blessed January 10, 1965 (223:01/10/65). The pastor said, “Never underestimate the power of Woman” (223:12/20/64) and, “Thanks to the devotion and sacrifice of the Guadalupanas, San José has a beautiful organ” (223:12/27/64). The Guadalupanas held another tamalada in January to pay for the organ (223:01/24/65) (223:03/07/65).

Sale of tamales was usually restricted to the fall of the year and the Christmas season. When the Guadalupanas sold food during other seasons of the year, tamales were usually not on the menu (223:03/20/66) (223:04/033/66) (223:10/16/66). Sometimes, as in February 1967, there were tamales left over from the Christmas season. That year, the Guadalupanas served a tamale breakfast after each Mass (223:02/05/67). They made and sold over 300 dozens of tamales and earned $260 (223:02/19/67). The income from the February tamale sale was used to pay for new gold-plated insignia medals for each member or Socia (223:04/23/67).

Because of their association with Christmas, the preparation and sale of tamales took place in the last half of the year. On a Saturday in October 1968, the Guadalupanas sold tamales in the parish hall from 10:00AM to 3:00PM “to help us (the church) with some of the “bills”” (223:10/20/68). If they wished to raise money earlier in the year, the Guadalupanas might bake and sell cakes instead (223: 01/26/70) (223:08/02/70). The Guadalupanas sponsored two booths in the May 2, 1976 church bazaar, one selling gifts and plants and the other a game called cherry tree (223:02/05/76). A tamale plate was sold at the bazaar but not by the Guadalupanas (223:09/05/76).

Until 1983, the church bazaar in April or May of each year was the most important parish-wide festival of the year. The first bazaars were on the church grounds but, in the 1950s, the bazaar took place indoors, almost always at the City Auditorium. The City Auditorium was located near the Colorado River, about three miles north of the church. Jamaicas took place out-of-doors, usually in June or July, and were not at first annual events. After the annual bazaars were discontinued in 1982, the Jamaicas became more important. The date of the Jamaica was moved from the summer to the fall, usually September, October or November. As the Jamaica became larger, the Guadalupanas began to emphasize the sale of tamales during the Jamaica as a way to raise money for the church.

After 1982, the Guadalupanas usually prepared and sold tamales before and during the fall fiesta/Jamaica (223:19/09/82). During the 1982 Jamaica, the Guadalupana’s gross sales from the tamale sale were $273. In terms of value of sales, tamale booth ranked number seven out of 38 booths (223:31/10/82). The following year, the net profit from the sale of tamales increased by ten times and for many years was the most profitable event at the Jamaica.

In September 1984, the Sunday Bulletin mentioned that the Guadalupanas had been working for many nights to make tamales for the Fall Fiesta (223:02/09/84). The work took place in the kitchen in the Community Center after 5:00PM (223:23/09/84). In July 1985, the President of the Guadalupanas asked anyone who would like to help make tamales for the Fall Fiesta to meet at the Community Center every Wednesday at 6:00PM (223: 14/07/1985). This announcement was in the Sunday Bulletin for about three weeks. The gross sales from the tamales at the 1984 Fiesta were $2,999.50. The Guadalupanas donated the entire sales to the church rather than deducting their expenses as the other booths did. The previous year, 1983, the net profit was $2,076.95 (223: 06/10/1985).

After 1984, the sale of tamales during the annual Jamaica became a tradition. The Guadalupanas sought donations of the ingredients used to make the tamales (223:02/08/1987) or sold tamales (223:09/10/1988) (223:02/12/1990) (223:08/11/1992) (223:06/12/1992) (223:24/12/1993) (223:24/01/1993) or cakes (223:12/04/1992) (223:19/05/1992) (223:02/05/1993) after Mass to raise money to purchase the ingredients. The Guadalupanas also appealed to the parishioners to donate their time to make the tamales. Volunteers were encouraged to gather at the parish hall to help (223: 25/10/1987) (223:24/07/1988) or to leave their contact information with the church office (223:24/07/1988). The tamales were made by hand and a large number of volunteers were needed to do the work (233:07/07/13). In 1990, the President of the Guadalupans, Becky Reyna, offered to teach volunteers how to make tamales as a way to encourage younger women to help (223:01/07/1990) (223:22/07/1990). As recently as 1993, the tamales were sold for $4 per dozen (223:14/02/1993).

In the 2008 tamalada, the Guadalupanas made 640 dozen tamales. They sold 44 dozen to raise money to purchase the ingredients. They ate 21 dozen, gifted 12 dozen to the church staff and set aside 17 dozen to sell at a Bingo Dinner. (The Bingo Dinner was a snack service that accompanied the monthly Friday night bingo games in the San José Community Center. In 2008, each ministry was asked to provide the service at least once annually.) 546 dozen tamales were sold at the Jamaica in 2008 (233).

In 2009, the tamalada was scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday for three weeks, August 25 & 26, September 1 & 2 and September 8 & 9. That year, the Guadalupana’s sponsored five booths at the Jamaica. The booths and gross sales of each were tamales (with sales of $3,803), funnel cakes (with sales of $1,650), plants (with sales of $612), country store (with sales of $273), aguas frescas (with sales of $315). The total sales of the five booths were $6,654.50, all of which was donated to the church (233).

In 2013, the Society voted to buy a machine to make tamales (233). The decision was difficult because it was a break with tradition. After much discussion over many months, three persons, Rosa Acosta, San Juanita López and Rosa Maria Mullins were instructed to travel to Fort Worth to purchase the machine and be trained in its use (233:07/07/13). The schedule for tamale making on Monday and Tuesday was August 5 & 6 and August 12 & 13 (233). In 2013, the Guadalupanas had three booths at the Jamaica: one that sold tamales, one that sold pastries and one that sold plants. The cookies, cakes and pies were made at home and donated (233). So many tamales were left over that in March 2014, the Guadalupana’s donated 115 dozen tamales to Casa Marinela, a shelter for homeless immigrants (233).

In 2014, the tamalada schedule was similar to that of the previous year. Volunteers gathered in the kitchen of the Community Center on Sunday evening and then again on Monday and Tuesday on Aug. 3, 4, 5 and August 10, 11, 12. On Sunday evening, beginning at 5:00PM, the meat is cooked and prepared. At 5:00AM the following Monday and Tuesday, the tamales are made and wrapped. The masa was purchased from a supplier already cooked (233). The Guadalupanas made 639 dozen tamales. They sold 76 dozen to purchase the ingredients, gifted 10 dozen to the church staff and sold others on September 16 as a fundraiser. The remainder was sold at the Jamaica (233). On September 16, the Guadalupanas sold take-out meals, one dozen tamales with beans and rice, sufficient to serve four persons for $15 (233:05/18/14). They also set aside tamales to serve, with chocolate, after the mañanitas on December 12 (233).

The schedule for 2015 and 2016 was similar. In 2016, the Guadalupana’s met three days a week for three weeks (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday) to make tamales. The goal was to make 500 dozen to sell at Jamaica and 75 dozen for sale elsewhere (233). Once again, they sold a take-out tamale dinner on September 16 as a fundraiser (233).

## The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, 1939- 1959

In 1939, prior to the construction of the San José church, several men who were members of the Society of the Sacred Heart at Guadalupe Church organized a similar society at San José church. Soon afterward, their wives formed the Society of the Sacred Heart of Mary (later changed to Society of Our Lady of Guadalupe or Guadalupanas). In 1940, these two organizations in San José church registered 26 and 24 members respectively. Fifteen young women enrolled in a society called Daughters of Mary (Hijas de María) and 20 young people enrolled in their own organization called Young Catholic Men (Juventud Católica). The four organizations included a large proportion of the 320 parishioners from 65 families that were registered in San José Church in 1940. These organizations formed the core group that worked with the Holy Cross Fathers to bring the Catholic faith to Mexican immigrants living south of the Colorado River in what was then the Diocese of San Antonio.

### Origins of the Society

The Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús is a pious association or sodality for married men. The origins of the Society at Guadalupe Church in Austin are unknown. In 1940, there were many such societies in Central Texas with the same name. Devotion to the Sacred Heart originated in Spain, was adopted by the Spanish Crown and brought to Mexico by the Jesuits (271). Devotion to the Sacred Heart of either Jesus or Mary is a widespread practice in Latin America (271).

An association of Mexican exiles organized two sodalities at San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio in August 1925 called Vasallos de Cristo Rey for men and Vasallas de Cristo Rey for women. Their commitment formula was, “For the honor and glory of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, perpetual king of Mexico, I submit myself voluntarily as his vassal…under the mantle of my holiest mother of Guadalupe, queen of the Mexican people”. The Sacred Heart of Jesus appeared on one side of the society’s member insignia and the Virgin of Guadalupe on the other (269). The Vasallos were an association of Catholic exiles who promoted devotion to Guadalupe as a means of obtaining peace in Mexico during the Cristero War. They were the most conspicuous group in the Guadalupe feast days in San Antonio (269).

The Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón in Texas may have their origins in the Vasallos de Cristo Rey. Mexicans who immigrated to rural Travis County were probably less patriotic and less focused on the Cristero War than the Vasallos of San Antonio. While devotion to the Sacred Heart, “confirmed the value of their language, cultural heritage and religious traditions” (269), they may have wished to tone down the political implications of their societies. The Archbishop of San Antonio may have had something to do with shifting the focus of the societies away from the conflict with the Mexican government and toward devotion to the Sacred Heart. The Reglamento de la Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón used by the Society at San José Church bears the imprimatur of Arthurus J. Drossaerts, Archbishop of San Antonio and is dated May 12, 1934 (198).

### Rules of the Society  

According to the Reglamento, membership is restricted to married men and single men over 20 years of age. Members are required to attend the Society’s corporate Mass on the first Sunday of the month, recite their commitment prayer daily as well as to pray the Lord’s Prayer and ten Avemarias. Officers are elected annually and members meet monthly. Members are obligated to attend the funeral and the first anniversary Mass of deceased Socios and to pay dues. The Reglamento specifies that the Society will have a banner and that the members will wear the insignia of the Society at group functions (198).

### Founding members

Luís Calderón, Estanislao Calderón and Antonio Castillo formed La Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús in 1939. Luís Calderón was elected the first President and he purchased the Society’s banner in Monterrey (3). Rev. Mendez’ Annual Report of December 1940 reported 26 Socios in December 1940. Pete Castillo identified the following men as members during the 1940s and 1950s. The date after the name refers to when each man joined the Society.

### 1940- 1960

The role of the Society in the construction of the various chapels of the Mexican Mission is not clear. The men who built the churches at San José, Creedmoor and Buda were parishioners of San José. José and Gabriel Gutierrez owned a truck that they used to carry the rock used in the buildings. Alfredo Moreno, Aventura Sosa, Luís Calderón and Simón and José Botello were the stonemasons and the altar boys, Chris Sosa, Peter Castillo, Vincente Flores, Henry Bargas and Lula Alva, worked as helpers (9) (14) (211). Most of these men appear on the membership rolls of the Society. José Rocha and Simón Ybarra moved to the neighborhood in 1941 (9). Simon L. Ybarra later moved to San Francisco Church (87). They both were Socios.

There are few written records prior to 1960 so it is difficult to detail precisely what the Society did during those years. They were probably involved in fundraising but there is no evidence of that. Prior to the departure of Fr. Mendez for Notre Dame in 1948, the Archbishop of San Antonio (84) and the Chancery Office (46) repeatedly advised him that, “the faithful are supposed to contribute to the maintenance of the church” (46), implying that they were not. When Rev. Frank Weber, C.S.C., built the rectory for San Jose Parish in 1948, all of his helpers were other Holy Cross priests and no mention is made of whether or not the parishioners helped (211).

During the 1950s, Joe Uriegas, Ramon de Leon and Pete Rivera were the Bingo Chairmen (210) when it appears that the Socios sponsored a bingo game in the parish hall at least once every two weeks. The Socios were involved in the construction of the second church (9) (12) (120). Membership rolls and accounts of their involvement with San Jose Parish after 1960 indicate that the Society was active in the parish in the years between 1941 and 1960.

## History of the Socios, 1960-1993

La Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús de la Iglesia de San José was organized in 1939. By all accounts, the Socios and the Guadalupanas were the largest and most active of the parish’s seven or eight pious associations during the first twenty years of the history of the parish. The early years of the Society, from 1940 to 1960, are described elsewhere. What follows is a detailed record of the activities of the Socios from 1960 until 1993.

### 1960

As stipulated in its Reglamento, the Society received Communion as a group on the 1st Sunday of the month at the 8:00AM Mass. Their monthly meetings followed at 11:00AM (223:12/04/60).

In 1960, the Socios hosted party games (including Bingo) on two Sundays of each month. The income, $2,633 for the calendar year, was donated to the church (223; 23/12/1962) (223:07/14/63). The Society also worked to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart, especially through the First Fridays Adorations. Their specific task was to provide flowers for Adoration on First Fridays (223:07/14/63). First Friday Adoration took place on the first Friday of each month from 6:15AM in the morning until 7:30PM at night (223:12/11/60). Members of all the sodalities at San José were encouraged participate and to wear their insignia to Mass each First Friday (223:05/28/60). Rev. Houser reminded the Socios, “… of the consoling promises of our Lord to those who receive Holy Communion on nine First Fridays in a row” (223:12/02/62).  

### 1961

The pastor often assigned other tasks to the Socios. The Socios were in charge of parking car during the annual Lenten Mission (223:02/12/61) and organized a procession to celebrate the Feast of Saint Joseph in March (223:03/19/61). In April, Luís Calderón and the Socios were tasked with selling “insignia” to pay for a new statue of San Jose (223:04/02/61) (223:04/09/61) (223:04/16/61).

In April 29, 1962, San Jose Parish hosted the annual Diocesan Hispanic Convention. The Socios volunteered to stage the event. The Guadalupanas were placed in charge of the food (223:01/21/62) and the Catholic War Veterans were in charge of parking cars (223:10/01/61). The Diocesan Convention was a large undertaking and planning began in November of the previous year. The Socios appointed five committees involving a total of 13 men to run the convention. Early meetings involved only the Socios and the Guadalupanas (223:11/05/61) but later meetings involved all the sodalities at San José (223:03/04/62).

In October 1961, Fr. Houser notified the Socios and Guadalupanas that there was to be an Episcopal Solemn High Mass in the City Auditorium and that the Bishop expected twenty men and women from San José wearing their insignia to participate in the procession. He instructed the presidents, Sr. José Maciel and Sra. Benigna Sosa, to give him a list of names of those attending (223:10/22/61).

### 1962

At the February meeting, the agenda included the Bishop’s Crusade for Vocations, the Diocesan Convention and the Parish Dance at City Coliseum for Mardi Gras (223:02/04/62). The Socios were involved in all these events. The Mardi Gras Dance was a joint effort of the Men’s Club, the Socios and the San José Post of the Catholic War Veterans. The net profit from the dance was $865 (223:02/25/62) (223:03/11/62).

In April, the Socios shared with the Cursillistas the responsibility of organizing the Holy Thursday Adoration that began at 9:00PM and lasted until 7:00AM the next morning (223:04/15/62). The Cursillos de Cristiandad was new to the Diocese and its parish-level component, the Ultreya, was a welcome addition to the roster of parish sodalities (12).

Fr. Houser asked the Socios and the Catholic War Veterans to handle the San José dance scheduled for July 28 (223:06/03/62). The dance was in the Coliseum with the Alfonso Ramos Orchestra. Houser said, “We want all of our dances to be truly Christian recreation” (223:07/22/62) meaning drunkenness would not be tolerated. Despite this restriction, the dance was a successful fundraiser with expenses of $448.50 and a profit of $1,069.75. “Will the same two groups take charge of the San Jose Dance on August 25th?” asked the parish priest (223:08/05/62). Of course, they agreed to do so. The second dance had a net profit of $995.00 (223:08/05/62).

During 1962, the Socios continued to host a Bingo game twice a month in the parish hall. Every year the parish struggled to make the payment on the loan for the church building. When the parish had set aside enough money to make the next payment, the pastor urged his parishioners to halt their fundraising. In October, the pastor gave the Socios the choice to continue or stop the games for the year. They decided to continue the games because they recognized that the parish relied on the Bingo profits to meet its expenses (223:10/21/62). The men who helped at the Sunday bingo were José Rocha, Jerome Estrada, L. Dalderon, José Maciel, Frutoso Hipolito, Santos Saucedo, Tony Cruz, R. Samilpa, Pete Castillo, Refugio Herrera, Fidercio Aguilar, Agustin Martínez, Fernando Sánchez and Pedro Rivera. They prepared the hall, sold the cards, called the numbers and paid the winners. After the games, they put everything back in its place (223:11/18/62). It took thirty minutes to prepare the hall and twenty minutes to clean up (223:02/03/63).  

### 1963

In 1963, the Society had forty-five members: Refugio Herrera, Jerome Estrada, Frutoso Hipolito, Fernando Sanchez, Fidercio Aguilar, Ben Arismendez, Enrique Acosta, Frank Acosta, Florencio Bargas, Roberto Bargas, Luís Calderón, Estanislado Calderón, Enrique Calderón, Carmen Calderón, Julian Calderón, Manuel Castillo, Ascencion Cardenas, Clemente Cazares, Antonio Cruz, Bonito Govea, Concepcion Gutierrez, Miguel Herrera, Julian Herrera, Julian Isla, Dolores Juarez, Alfredo Loera, Victor Loera, Jose Maciel, Agustin Martinez, Margarito Martinez, Luz Ojeda, Ignacio Perez, Serafin Peña, José Rocha, Nicomedes Rocha, Julian Ramos, Jacinto Ramos, Pedro Rivera, Jose Ramirez, Agustin Rodriguez, Ramon Samilpa, Santos Saucedo, Marcelo Saucedo, Isidro Samilpa, Pedro Tamayo and Ben Vega (223:01/13/63).

In February 23, the Socios helped at all doors and at the ticket office for the Mardi Gras dance on Saturday at the City Coliseum (223:02/10/63) (223:02/17/63). Among the many tasks assigned to the Socios was the repair of church buildings.  At the August monthly meeting, the Socios planned work parties for Monday and Tuesday, set up a committee for the 25th Anniversary of the parish, renewed the Rules for use of the Hall and enlarged the hall committee (223:08/04/63). In 1963, the party games earned $4,006.00 for the church. The games ended on December 22 and restarted on January 5 (223:12/22/63)

### 1964

In February 1964, the Socios installed new lights to illuminate the church parking lot (223:02/23/64) and, in March, delivered boxes of donation envelopes that had not been picked up from the church. Fr. Houser asked the Socios to form a Committee for Vocations. The committee attended meetings of men from other parishes and directed the Bishop’s Crusade for Vocations at the parish (223:03/01/64). The 1963 committee was Fernando Sanchez, Jerome Estrada and Refugio Herrera. The new committee was Fernando Sanchez, Jerome Estrada, Refugio Herrera, Frutoso Hipolito, Ben Aresmendez and Roberto Bargas (223:03/08/64).

When the Presidenta of the Guadalupanas, Benigna Sosa, passed away, the Society dedicated a High Mass to her memory and attended the Mass as a group (223:05/10/64). The Reglamento of the Society required an anniversary Mass for deceased Socios (198) and the Socios decided to recognize the bond between the Socios and the Guadalupanas by extending the honor to the deceased president of the Guadalupanas.

In June and August, the pastor made a call for men to help repair one of the parish buildings. “Would volunteers please come on Monday and Tuesday after supper? Bring tools and paint brushes” (223:06/28/64). In August, all men of San Jose were invited to help tile the floor of the school buildings on Friday night at 7:00PM. Fr. Houser said, “the Socios were invited at their meeting on Sunday, the Catholic Veterans on Tuesday and the Ultreya on Wednesday at 8:00PM. The rest of you are invited now. No one is forgotten” (223:08/02/64).

In October, the Socios began selling food in the parish hall as a fundraiser. They sold a barbecue plate for $1 from 10:00AM to 2:00PM on Sunday consisting of chicken, beans, rice and potato salad (223:10/11/64). They earned $105 (223:10/18/64). The next week, they served menudo after each Mass (223:10/18/64) for a net profit of $107 (223:11/01/64). On December 6, they sold menudo and took in $81.25 (223:12/06/64) and on Saturday, December 12, hosted a turkey bingo (party games for turkeys) at 8PM (223:12/06/64). They also approved a plan to send collection envelopes monthly to each family through the mail rather than placing the box of envelopes in the church foyer to be picked up (223:12/08/63) (223:10/04/64).  

### 1965

In 1965, the Socios sponsored major events in February and March. The February event was a Fiesta Grande and a “concursito”. The Fiesta Grande consisted of a comedic play followed by dinner and a dance. The “concursito” involved the crowning of a sweetheart. The sweetheart candidates were Brenda Joyco Ramos, Maria Elena Cortez, Carmelita Limon, Sylvia Barrientos and Juanita Huerta (223:02/21/65). The Concursito earned $207.11 and the fiesta earned $51.35 for a total of $258.46 (223:02/28/65). In March, the Socios organized a fiesta and procession to honor the patron saint of the parish, San José (223:03/21/65).

They continued the dinner program begun in 1964. In lieu of their regular meeting at 11:00AM, they served a dinner plate from 11:00AM to 3:00PM (223:06/06/65). Prior to 1970, there were no breakfast groups that sold breakfast after Mass and only occasionally did one of the sodalities sell lunch or dinner in the parish hall to the entire parish community. Most such events were private events open only to invited persons (223:06/07/70).  

The party games hosted by the Socios were scheduled for once every two weeks at 8:00PM on Sunday night (223:08/01/65). The profits were typically $100 to $150 per night (223:08/01/65). The Socios decided to host a weekly game beginning on Wednesday, August 18 (223:08/08/65). When this decision was made, the officers of the Society were President- Roberto Bargas; Vice President- Frutoso Hipolito; Secretary- Fernando Sanchez; Pro Secretary- Ben Arismendez; Treasurer- Jose Maciel and Pro Treasurer- Fidencio Aguilar (223:12/08/63). The officers were elected at the December meeting (223:11/26/67) and installed in January.

### 1966

In March, the Socios were placed in charge of parking cars in the parking lot on Sundays (223:03/27/66). In June, the parish began to plan for the opening of the new San José parochial school building that was scheduled for September 16 (92). Apparently, the Socios were in charge of the celebration. The pastor announced, “All the Faithful of the Parish are invited to join the Socios in celebrating the 16th of September here” (223:06/26/66). When Bishop Riecher came to bless the new school on November 6 (12), the Socios took advantage of the opportunity to sell food. They also found an orchestra that provided the music at the blessing of the new school (223:10/16/66) (223:11/06/66).

The Reglamento of the Society requires that the Socios celebrate Mass for defunct members on the Feast of All Souls in November. At San Jose, the Memorial Mass is celebrated in June on the Feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. On June 12, 1966, the Sunday Bulletin announced, “the Feast of the Sacred Heart is a Feast representing the love of Jesus for us. It is the Feast day of the Socios of Sagrado Corazón. We would like to see all Socios, with insignia, at Mass” (223:06/12/66). The Feast of the Sacred Heart is always on Friday and sometimes falls on the First Friday of the month.  Fr. Houser said, “We wish to put in the hands of the Guadalupanas and Socios the spreading of our two big devotions: First Friday and Wednesday Novena Mass (223:01/22/67).

### 1967

During 1967, the Socios continued to meet in the school building at 11:00AM on the first Sunday of the month (223:08/06/67). Their corporate communion was on the same Sunday at the 8:00AM Mass (223:12/05/67). For the corporate Mass, the Socios gathered at the entrance of the church and processed into the sanctuary with their banner ahead of the officiants. They sat together and took Communion together. The pastor reminded other parishioners to not disrupt the group by cutting into the line.   

The Socios managed Bingos games on 8:00PM on Wednesday and 8:00PM on Sunday (223:11/26/67). They sold barbecue plates in February and raised $76 (223:02/19/67). In December the Sunday Bulletin announced that a group of men built a playground for the school consisting of basketball and volleyball standards, swings, see-saw, a chinning bar and a merry-g-round (223:12/03/67).

### 1968

On January 14, the Socios held a joint meeting with the Guadalupanas to discuss plans to build the San José Community Center. In 1967, the two sodalities donated $9,585.24 to the church. Both Societies donated $3,000 to the school fund and the Socios gave another $3,585.24 from profits from the Bingo games (223:01/21/68). Plans were made to increase their fundraising efforts to help pay for the new parish hall (223:07/07/68).   

In April 7, the first Sunday of the month, both Societies had their corporate  
Mass at 8:00AM followed by meeting of Socios in the school at 11:00AM and Guadalupanas in the school at 2:00PM (223:04/07/68). The Guadalupanas traditonally had their corporate Mass and meeting on the second Sunday of each month or the Sunday which falls nearest the 12th of the month (209). Beginning in January 1979, the Guadalupanas moved their corporate Communion to the First Sunday of each month with the monthly meeting following immediately afterward in the Community Center (223:28/01/79) (223:25/02/79). This change meant that the two largest sodalities at San Jose attended corporate Communion together and held their monthly meetings at the same time.

On Monday, April 22, 1968, a photographer from La Fuerza newspaper came to the school meeting room at 7:30PM to take pictures of the officers of each society at San José (223:04/21/68).

### 1969

During 1969, the Socios continued to manage Bingo games on Sunday and Wednesday nights each week. The income from the Bingo was used to pay the debt on the school. In February, the pastor thanked the Socios del Sagrado Corazón who gave $12,465.12 to pay the interest and principal on the school debt (223: 02/02/69). The Socios, led by Fernando Sanchez, were also in charge of the Bingo at the May 4 bazaar. There is no mention of the Socios sponsoring a booth. Frank Castruita was in charge of the raffle and Luís Calderón was in charge of the program booklet (223:04/27/69).

The Socios also sponsored at least two dances during the year. The first was on November 1 in the Community Center with a band called Los Calavelitos (223:10/26/69). The second dance was on Saturday, December 27, with Erasmo Flores Orchestra. The entry price for the dancers was $3 or $3.50 per couple (223:12/21/69).

During 1969, the monthly Communion Day for the Socios was the first Sunday with the meeting following at 11:00AM (following the 10:00AM Mass) in the school building (223:07/06/69) (223:09/07/69) (223:10/05/69).

### 1970

The first function at the new parish hall was on Saturday, October 11, 1969 (223:10/05/69). It quickly became apparent that the San José Community Center was an ideal location for dances. Several San Jose parish groups, including the Socios, began to sponsor dances in the new Community Center. During 1970 and 1971, fifty four dances were held there. The new building also improved attendance at the party games hosted by the Socios and income from the games increased.

A loan of $80,000 at 4 ½ % was used to finance the construction (213) and the Socios recognized that a large portion of that new burden would fall on them. In January 1970, the Socios donated $10,642.31 to help pay the six-month installment and interest payments on the school and the new hall (223:01/04/70) (223:04/05/70). During 1970, the two Bingos sponsored by the Socios on Monday and Wednesday nights had a total income of $14,383.91. The Socios also sponsored dances that had a total income for the year of $2,705.42 (223:01/03/71). During 1970, the Bingo games and dances managed by the Socios earned enough to pay the principle and interest on the school and hall debt and to purchase CCD books (223:01/31/71).

In 1970, the Socios hosted six or seven dances at the Community Center (223:01/11/70) (223: 02/01/70) (223:06/28/70) (223:07/12/70) (223:08/09/70) (223:09/05/70) (223:11/08/70). The weekly party games continued on Wednesday and the semi-monthly party games on Sunday continued (223:01/03/71). In July, the Socios and Manuel Garcia sponsored a Turkey Benefit Dinner for the parish (223:07/12/70).

In April, delegates from the San José Society attended the annual convention of Spanish speaking people at St. John the Evangelist Church in San Marcos where San José had a float in the parade (223:04/26/70). The Society continued to add new members and in June the Society received three new members (Albert Mercado,Vincent Ortiz and David Laurel) at the 8:00AM Mass. The Mass was followed by breakfast for all Socios in the Community Center (223:06/07/70).

In October, the Socios changed their meeting schedule. For the next six months, the meetings took place immediately after the 8:00AM Mass. The meetings were in the Community Center (223:10/04/70) (223:11/01/70).   

### 1971

In 1971, José Rocha and Gonzalo Reyna ran the Monday and Wednesday night Bingo games (223:06/06/71). The PTA ran Bingo games on Friday. Income from the three Bingo games surpassed the Sunday Collection. Income from Bingo in May totaled $3,417. By comparison, the five Sunday Collections in May came to a total of $2,617 (223:06/06/71). During the year, profits from the Monday and Wednesday Bingo games were used to pay $11,467.50 on the school debt and $14,026.25 on the Community Center debt (223: 13/02/72).  

In March, the schedule of the Society reverted back to Mass was at 8:00AM on the first Sunday of each month with the meeting at the school at 11:00AM (223: 03/10/71). In July, the Socios donated $500 to purchase a new station wagon for the parish (223: 08/01/71).

### 1972

The Socios continued to sponsor dances at the Community Center but less frequently. Much of their available time was occupied by the Bingo games on Monday and Wednesday nights (223: 16/01/72). They also managed the Bingo games at the annual bazaar in May. The income from that game was $482 (223: 21/05/72).

During 1972, the Socios donated $11,197.50 toward the interest and principal on the school debt; $13,641.25 toward the interest and principal on the hall debt and $1,000.00 to cover general expenses of the parish. Most of this money came from the Monday and Wednesday Bingo games.

### 1973

On January 7, the Guadalupana’s served dinner for the Socios from 5PM to 7PM on Sunday, finishing in time to prepare for the Bingo game that began at 8PM (223: 07/01/73). The next Saturday, the Socios sponsored a dance in the Community Center with El Flaco Jimenez. Tickets were $3 per person (223: 07/01/73).

The Socios ran the Bingo games at the annual bazaar in the spring and made $421.47 (223: 01/07/73). In September, they helped repair the Youth Center and the Convent. Both structures were World War Two-era wooden buildings and needed major repairs. The crew that worked on the repairs included Geronimo Estrada, Julian Lopez, Roger Ybarra, Alfredo Botello, Rufas Vasquez and Roger Gonzalez (248: 02/10/73).

At the end of 1973, the Bingo workers included José Rocha, Gonzalo Reyna, Pete Tamayo and Ray and Aggie Castro (249:11/11/73).

1974

Little mention was made of the Socios in the Sunday Bulletin during 1974 except that they elected officers on Sunday, Nov. 24, 2-4PM in the school. The president was L. Hernandez (250: 17/11/74). The twice weekly Bingo games continued and the Socios must have sponsored at least some of the eight dances that took place in the Community Center during the year. The Socios were always heavily involved in the church bazaar in May and usually sponsored the Bingo games and a booth selling beer (223:18/05/75).

### 1975

Planning for the annual bazaar began in February (223:16/02/75). As usual, the Socios were placed in leadership roles in the Bazaar Committee. In March, they sold barbecue after 8:00AM, 10:00AM and 12:00 Noon Masses at $1.50 per plate to raise seed money for the bazaar. They were also seeking donations for gift items for use at the bazaar as Bingo Prizes (223:09/03/75). In addition to running the games at the bazaar, the Socios raised $382 for the bazaar with a dinner and dance (223:18/05/75). The Guadalupanas, under the leadership of Francis Treviño, sponsored a procession and a Rosary every Sunday at 7PM during the month of May (223:11/05/75).

In July, the Socios served a barbecue dinner after the 8:00AM, 10:00AM and 12:00 Noon Mass with potato salad, beans, drink, etc. for $1.50. The dinner was a fundraiser for the church renovation project that was just getting started (223:13/07/75). On Sunday, October 19, the Socios called a special meeting of all members at 11:00AM in the school (223:19/110/75), perhaps to discuss the upcoming visit of Bishop Mendez. The program of the 35th Anniversary celebration had this to say about the Sociedad Del Sagrado Corazón De Jesús. “Our Socios began in the tiny chapel of the Sisters on Johanna Street in 1939 and there began the planning for the mission of San José on West Mary Street. Over the years, these men have led our parish in religious, educational and social activities. They have worked closely with all our pastors, devoting their efforts to sponsorship of games, barbecues and Jamaicas” (209).

### 1976

Between July 1975 and July 1976, San Jose Church had three different pastors (223:14/12/75) (223:11/07/76). The interim pastor, Rev. Lawrence Bauer, had only a few months to become acquainted with the parish before he was replaced by Rev. John Korscmar, C.S.C. (223:27/06/76). The parish administrator, Fr. Bauer, set a meeting on March 8, after the Monday night Bingo games, to meet with the Parish Council and the bingo group. He said that in the last four months he met with Parish Council once and had not yet met with Bingo group (223:07/03/76).

In April, the Socios served food after all Masses on the church grounds to raise money for the spring Bazaar (223:24/04/76). The Socios also sponsored the Bingo games at the bazaar on May 2 (223:02/05/76).

In June, the Society of the Sacred Heart at Guadalupe Church in Austin invited all members of the Society to celebrate the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. The event ended with a Solemn High Mass followed by supper at the Parish Hall (223:20/06/76). This event probably celebrated an anniversary of the founding of the Society at Guadalupe Church. In 1976, Sociedades del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús existed in at least six Central Texas parishes (13).

The Socios at San Jose also managed the Bingo game at the annual spring Bazaar. In 1976, the Bingo games run by the Socios had the largest net profit ($583) of any booth at the spring Bazaar (223:09/05/76).

### 1977

In 1977, the Socios and the San Jose School PTA were running Bingo games three nights each week at the San José Community Center. Even though the games were illegal, the parish had become reliant on the income from the party games to pay the principal and interest on the loans used to finance the San Jose School and the San Jose Community Center.

On Wednesday, October 26, 1977, a lawyer named Madalyn Murray O’Hair and her companion, Sam Miller, entered the San Jose Community Center and disrupted the Wednesday night Bingo game. Ray Martinez, who was helping with the games that night, said she rushed in, “grabbing bingo cards, pushing and shaving people, (while) a man who was with her (Sam Miller) started punching people”. Ray and other men pushed O’Hair and her companion out of the Community Center and called the Austin police. Mrs. O’Hair filed a federal law suit seeking punitive damages against State and County officials for not enforcing antigambling laws. In June 1978, a U.S. District Judge dismissed the case (251) but the games at San Jose came to an end.

### 1978

In September 1978, the Socios met on Tuesday at 8PM in the school to share their thoughts on the readings from the Sunday Mass (223:10/09/76). This was the regular meeting of the Socios (223:17/09/78). The program was to discuss the Gospel reading from the previous Sunday (223: 30/09/78).

Sometime after 1939, Luís Z. Calderón, who was the leader of the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús at San Jose for many years, was given charge of the María De La Luz Mexican Cemetery. The circumstances of how the Socios at San Jose assumed this responsibility are not known. The San José Socios maintained the cemetery until at least 1986. For several years prior to 1986, José Herrera, a member of the Society at San José, had custody of the cemetery book and map on behalf of the Socios.

In October 1978, the Socios cleaned up La Luz Cemetery to get it ready for Mass on All Soul’s Day. They started at 9AM. Food and refreshments were provided (223:08/10/78). The Pastor wrote, “In years past, we have had a Mass on All Souls Day at La Luz Cemetery and we will again this year”. The Mass began at 6:30PM at around sunset (223:22/10/78). Parishioners were advised to bring a light.

The Socios sold hamburgers at the Fall Fiesta on November 12 and made a profit of $30.00 (223:19/11/78). Their booth was one of 17 booths at the fall festival. The raffle was the largest moneymaker ($1,220) followed by a turkey dinner that netted $518 (223:19/11/78).  (223:26/11/78). Two years later, the Socios operated two booths at the November 1 Fall Fiesta: Beer and Nachos (223: 01/11/1981). Someone else was assigned to prepare and sell hamburgers.

### 1979-1980

The Socios elected new officers at the December or January meeting (223:07/01/79). They met in the school at 11AM on the First Sunday of each month (223:28/01/79)  (223:25/02/79). Freed of the responsibility of running party games two nights each week, the Socios focused on other activities. They became more involved with the Fall Fiesta (223:20/09/1981) (223: 01/11/1981).

### 1981

During 1981, Enrique Saenz was the President of the Socios (223:07/06/1981). The Socios met at 9:45AM in the school on the second Sunday of each month (223:09/08/1981) (223:06/09/1981) (223: 01/11/1981). The Society sponsored a candidate for King or Queen of the Fall Fiesta that was held on Sunday, November 1 on the San Jose grounds (223:20/09/1981) and operated two booths selling beer and nachos (223: 01/11/1981).

### 1982

In 1982, José Jimenez was the president of the Socios Del Sagrado Corazón (223:27/06/82). The Socios changed their meeting times back to the first Sunday at 10AM (223:06/06/82). The pastor, Fr. John Korcsmar, urged all adults to join the Socios, Guadalupanas or the Catholic Adult Organization (223:08/08/82).

The Socios and Mr. Lawrence Salas sponsored the kick-off event for the San José Fall Fiesta at a dance on August 28. Lefty Lopez provided the music and tickets were $7 at the door or $5 in advance. Tacos, nachos, set ups and beer were available at the dance. Victor Balderas, a San José Choir Director and popular DJ, was the master of ceremonies. The Socios sponsored two booths at the Fall Fiesta in September, selling beer and hosting a Cooking of Menudo Contest (223:19/09/82). The beer booth had the highest sales of all 38 booths with sales of $1,103. The income from the menudo cooking contest sales were $21 (223:31/10/82).

### 1983

New officers for the Socios and the Guadalupanas were installed on January 9 at the same Mass (223:26/12/82). The new officers of the Socios were: José Jiménez, President; Enrique L. Saenz, Vice-president; Raymond Castro, Secretario; Mack Carmona, Pro-Secretario; Greg Trejo, Tesorero; Juán Flores, Pro-Tesorero; José Rocha, Celador;  Daniel Acuña, Celador and Domingo Lugo, Parlamentario (223:30/01/83).

In March, the Socios helped Benito Govea Sr. cut tree branches so they could be hauled away. Mr. Govea had a truck that he used whenever he could. The Socios provided breakfast for 95 people who donated blood during the blood drive sponsored by the church (223:13/03/83). The drive took place over two weeks in March (223:13/03/83).

The bylaws of the Society require the Socios to attend Mass on the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Feast usually falls in June but, for some reason, this Mass was celebrated on Saturday, May 7 in 1983 (223:01/05/83). The next day, the Sunday Bulletin announced that Enrique Saenz supervised the dumping and leveling of 100 loads of topsoil (valued at $40 a load) on the church grounds but there was no mention of who paid for the topsoil except that it was donated (223:08/05/83). The area next to the Rectory was filled and leveled and topsoil was spread over the church lawn where it was bare and low. The Socios volunteered to plant grass there although it was heavily shaded. José Álvares donated the bulldozer work.

In the same edition of the Sunday Bulletin, the pastor wrote, “Para embellezer mas a nuestro terreno, ultimamente se les extiendo un cordial invitacion a todos los demas hombres de San Jose a ingresar a esta sociedad y participar en el crecimiento de la parroquia como tambien en la vida espiritual”. There was no indication that this referred to the Socios but was printed in the same bulletin that described the work of leveling the grounds (223:08/05/83). The Socios in 1983 and continuing to the present day conducts its business in Spanish.

### 1984

Nueva Mesa Directiva de Los Socios Para 1984 y 1985; Presidente Juán Flores, Vice Presidente Paul Martinez, Secretario José Jiménez, Pro Secretario Robert Martinez, Tesorero Luis Martinez, Pro Tesorero Ray Castro, Parlamentario Jesse Hernandez, Parlamentario Alsonso López, Celadores- Greg Trejo, Enrique L. Saenz (223:January 1984).

The March 11 edition of the Sunday bulletin announced a benefit dinner for Joe Rocha and John Riojas Sr. without further explanation (223:11/03/84). The benefit dinner was sponsored by the Socio and the Guadalupanas and raised $476 for the medical bills of the two men (223:25/03/84). Joe Rocha was in the hospital (223:08/04/84). A note from John Riojas appeared in the Sunday Bulletin thanking the Socios, Guadalupanas and parishioners of San José for their help (223:15/04/84). Later another note thanked Juan Flores and the Socios for the fundraising dinner and Mr. Aurelio Estrada for his monetary donation toward José Rocha’s medical bills (223:20/05/84). José Rocha, who with Luís Calderón, had managed the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús at San José since the 1940s, died in August (223: 25/08/1985). Luís Calderón had moved to Montopolis in 1969 and died in 1979. The passing of Luís Calderón and José Rocha marked the end of an era for the Society from which it never recovered.

In July, the Socios sold a barbecue chicken plate in the Community Center to benefit Frank Acosta (223:01/07/84) and in late July a benefit dance was held to raise money to help John Riojas (223:22/07/84). In 1984, the Guadalupanas and Socios led the prayers at First Friday Adoration for one hour on a rotating basis with four other parish sodalities (223:01/07/84).

### 1985

In 1985, the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was Friday, June 14. The Mass intention was for the Sacred Heart Society. The Promises of Our Lord to Blessed Margaret Mary in favor of those devoted to his Sacred Heart were printed in the Sunday Bulletin (223: 09/06/1985).

In 1985, the Socios sponsored two dances. One, in August, was in association with the 8:00AM Choir (223: 28/07/1985). The other was in December when the Socios
sponsored a dance with Rubern Perez y Los Cinco Reyes y Los Farolitos in the Community Center from 8:00PM to 1:00AM. Tickets were $4 pre-sale and $6 at the door (223: 01/12/1985).

### 1986

The Socios had a work day at the church in March to cut down a tree and trim others (223; 02/03/1986). The trees in question were ancient live oaks that today would be considered “heritage trees” and would require a permit from the City to cut. Greg Trejo and the Socios repaired the air conditioner at Fr. Joe’s Place (the Old Convent) repaired the church pick-up truck, the beer box and the large refrigerator at the Community Center (223: 31/08/1968).

In November, the pastor installed two new members, Miguel Velarde and Lorenzo Rodriguez (223:09/11/1986) and, in December, officers for 1987 were elected. The new officers were Greg Trejo, Presidente; John Rivera, Vice-Presidente; José Jiménez, Secretario; Juán Flores, Tesorero; Daniel Acuña, Celador; Domingo Lugo, Banner Bearer/Abanderado (223:14/12/1986).

### 1987

During February 1987, Greg Trejo and the Socios built a fenced-in storage area near the Community Center for storage of building materials for the new (third) church (223:22/02/1987). The officers for 1988 were elected in the December meeting. They were John Rivera, President; Daniel Acuña, Vice President; Juan Flores, Treasurer; Tom Longoria, Secretary; Miguel Velarde, Banner Bearer/Abanderado; Enrique Saenz, Advisor and Deacon Alfredo Vasquez, Chaplain (223: 13/12/1987).

### 1988

In June, Greg Trejo and the Socios spread dirt on the lawn beside the old church in an attempt to get the grass to grow there (223:19/06/1988). In June 1988, the Socios announced a new mesa directive. The President and Vice-President were replaced by Paul Martinez, Presidente and Robert Martinez, Vice-Presidente. The other officers retained their offices, i.e. Tomas Longoria, Secretario; Juán Flores, Tesorero; Consejeros- Henry (Enrique) Saenz, José Jiménez, Gregorio (Greg) Trejo. Billy Nichols was received as a new member and Isabel Pérez was reinstated as a member.  

The pastor used this opportunity to try to recruit new members to strengthen the sodality. He wrote, “La Sociedad se dedica al servicio de la parroquia, tanto materialmente como espiritualmente. Estan dispuestos a server en lo que el sacerdote les pida. La mesa directive les hace una cordial invitacion a que ingresen a esta noble sociedad tanto a nuevos miembros como antiguos que se ha retirado por un motivo o otro” (223:26/06/1988).

During 1988, the parish was struggling to pay for the new church and most sodalities sponsored fundraisers for the church, In September, the Socios sold a barbecue lunch and donated the profits ($248.90) to the church. On September 25, the Socios sold a Crispy Taco Plate of two tacos, beans, rice and tea for $3 after the 11:00AM and 12:30PM Masses (223:25/09/1988).

### 1990

The Socios purchased a barbecue pit that they kept under the porch of the parish hall. Someone stole the barbecue pit and the pastor urged the thief (he used the word “borrower”) to bring it back. The announcement appeared in Spanish and English (223:02/09/1990). The appeal was repeated in September and November (223:04/11/1990) probably without success. Any item stored out-of-doors risked being stolen by young men living in the neighborhood.

### 1991

The Socios rotated with three other groups (Chico Govea and crew, S.A.U.V.E. Youth Group and the Guadalupanas) to serve breakfast after the first two Masses during 1991. The Socios and their wives who performed this service included Manuel Castillo, Julian Gutierrez, Elias Rangel, Jose Jimenez, Richard Galvan, Alfredo Rangel, Greg Trejo, Lorenzo Rodriguez, Gloria Vasquez and Jesus Gutierrez.

The officers for 1992 were Luis Martinez, President; Lorenzo Rodriguez, VP; Greg Trejo, Treasurer and Jose Jimenez, Secretary (223:29/12/1991).

### 1992-1993
