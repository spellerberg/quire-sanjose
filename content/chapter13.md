## San Jose Parish Registers

The Diocese of Austin has a manual called “Parish Record Keeping Manual” that describes what kinds of sacramental records a parish is required to keep. Per the Code of Canon Law, each parish must maintain baptism, confirmation, marriage and death registers. Records of First Communion are optional. The original records are never to be destroyed and their accuracy must never be questioned (273). The diocese microfilmed the old registers in 1992.

The records of sacramental events, such as a marriage or baptism, are entered into bound registers and a computer. The registers kept in a locked safe. Although baptism and marriage records are available to the public, State law and diocesan policy requires that that information be kept confidential for 80 years to protect against identity theft. Because of that requirement, the information in the sacramental records of San Jose is not yet available to the public.

The parish has a part-time employee who enters the information into the registers and the computer program. Confirmation, marriage and holy orders must be noted in the same parish where baptism took place. Keeping the records current often requires extensive correspondence with other parishes. Theoretically, the baptism record of each Catholic would list each sacrament received by that person including confirmation, marriage and even death. In reality, it is very difficult to reach that goal. Based upon the number of entries made in the San Jose Parish Registers over the last eighty years, 60% of those baptized receive First Communion, 36% are confirmed, 25% marry and only 17% die.

### Combined Parish Register, 1939-1949 listing Baptism, Marriage, First Communion, Confirmation and Death.

The first entry into this register was made on May 21, 1939 by Rev. J. W. Donahue, C.S.C. The second entry is dated June 4, 1939 (also by Fr. Donahue) and the third entry dates from August 27, 1939 (by Rev. A. Mendez, C.S.C). The register has 163 entries entered by eight different priests (James W. Donahue, Alfred Mendez, Alfred Send, Thomas Culhane, Joseph F. Houser, J. Gibbons, James C. D’Autremont and William H. Malony). These were the missionary priests who helped with the Mexican Mission in 1939 and 1940. All of these entries were transcribed to other volumes specific to each sacrament.

The entries in the Combined Parish Register were examined and verified by John J. Robling, Dean on Oct. 17, 1943 and by Bishop Rober Lucey on October 4, 1944.
The register bears the mark of the Archbishop of San Antonio, Visum in Visitativne Can +Robertus E. Lucey S.A., 10-44-44 on page 70.

#### Marriages

Contents: Marriages, San Jose Church and Mission, Sept. 3, 1939
Pages 28 to page 54, 104 entries between Sept. 3, 1939 and May 14, 1944

The first entry is dated Sept. 3, 1939, the second entry is dated Sept. 17, 1939 and the third entry is Dec. 10, 1939, all by A. Mendez, C.S.C.  Witnesses include the two New Mexico Catechists, Sister Richardson and Sister Dorava, Brother Lambert CSC of St. Edward’s University and Fr. Leaby CSC. The priests who performed the marriage included A. Mendez, J. Prieto OMI of Guadalupe Church Austin, James W. Donahue, Joseph F. Houser, Alfred Send, Thomas J. Culhane and Peter F. Mueller.
