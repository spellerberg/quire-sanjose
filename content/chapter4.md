## Women's groups

### The San José Society

In the San Jose Church Photo Archives is a photocopy of a snapshot and a note written by Ysidra A. Uriegas. The snapshot shows Rev. Mendez in the traditional black habit of a priest with twelve women and one child standing in the side yard of first San José Church on W. Mary Street. The photograph was made between 1945 and 1948. The note contains the following information (210).

In 1945, Rev. Mendez organized twelve newly wed wives of soldiers into the San José Society. The first President was Isidra A. Uriegas. The other members were Mrs. Georgia Lucy Ramos, Hortensia Hinojosa, Hattie Calderon, Concha De Leon, Amelia Resas, Consuelo López, Celia Guerra, Camille Pinedo, Angelina López and Lupe Álvarez. At that time, the church owned a wooden building at the corner of Live Oak and S. 2nd Street and the San Jose Society met there. Their fundraisers were Bonco parties at 25 cents per game.

The activities of the San Jose Society included helping the Guadalupanas in the kitchen. The Guadalupanas were older women who prepared and served food for parish-wide events. The menu usually included tamales, menudo, tacos and enchiladas. The San José Society sponsored entertainment for the Jamaicas or fiestas that were organized by the Guadalupanas. They recruited volunteers from among the young people of the parish to sing and dance at the Jamaicas. Older ladies taught the youngsters traditional Mexicans songs and dances which they performed on stage.

The San José Society also helped at the bingos held in the San José parish hall. The note written by Mrs. Uriegas says that in 1945 the Bingo Chairmen were Joe Uriegas, Ramón De Leon and Peter Rivera (210). The women of the San José Society must have helped at the bingo games held in the wooden barracks that served as the parish hall until the San José Community Center was built in 1968. Prior to 1962, these games took place on Sunday night. The ladies of the San José Society sold pork roast tacos for three for $1. They also sold coffee, pastries, popcorn and sodas.

The note says that the San José Society also helped sell bricks for the Brick Project to fund the 2nd church on Oak Crest Street. It is unknown where the bricks were placed. Construction on the second San José Church began in July 1955 so the Society must have still existed in 1955. There is no mention of the San José Society in the Sunday Bulletins. The Sunday Bulletins were not published until December 1960 so the San José Society probably ceased to exist sometime prior December 1960.

The names of two of the women listed as founding members of the San José Society in 1945 (Amelia Resas and Celia Guerra) are found on lists of Guadalupanas made after 1960 and three of the women (Amelia Resas, Lupe Álvarez and Isidra Uriegas) appear on the rolls of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Catholic War Veterans Post 1085 in 1965 or 1966 (223:02/14/1965) (223:09/10/1967).

### Get-Together for Women/ Women's Night Out

In the fall of 1963, the women of the church were invited to attend a women’s only event at Tuesday night at 7:00PM. Their husbands were expected to stay home with the children. These events continued until 1965 on an occasional basis. On January 11, 1964 women were invited to bring food for supper and a style show. It was announced as a Mardi Gras Fiesta (223:02/09/64). By April, the event was called Get-Together for Women (223:04/26/64). The last known Get-Together for Women of San José was on Thursday, March 4, 1965. All women were invited to an event that started at 7:00PM (223:02/28/65).

In July 1990, Sherry Joseph, the wife of Deacon George Joseph, announced the formation of a Women’s Co-Dependency Support Group to meet in the school on Tuesday at 7:45PM (223:01/07/1990). Deacon George Joseph formed a Men’s Co-Dependency Support Group that also met on Tuesday at 7:45PM. Co-dependency was defined in the Sunday Bulletin (223:08/07/1990). In September both groups changed their meeting time and place to 7PM in the school (223:09/09/1990). The Women’s Co-dependency Group continued to meet until December 8, 1991 (08/12/1991).

In the fall of 1991, two new groups, an Alcohol Anonymous group and the Back to Life Support Group, were organized. It is not clear if the “Back to Life” support group was a continuation of the co-dependency and AA groups or if it addressed the needs of a new group of parishioners. The pastor said, “People experiencing grief of any kind were invited, including Divorce, conflicts in your marriage, dealing with raising children as a single parents” (223:19/01/1992). It was a co-ed group.

## Altar Society

An altar society is a group of laypersons who maintain the ceremonial objects used in worship. It is a sodality and also a liturgical ministry. Membership is usually open to all women 18 years or age or older. The sodality may have by-laws that state the purpose of the society. In addition to assisting in church functions as do all sodalities, the specific purpose of the society is to take care of the needs of the church altar and sacristy. This includes the altar wine and hosts, care and cleaning of the vestments, server robes, purificators and altar linens, candles, flowers and other furnishings.

According to the website of San José Parish, the mission of the Altar Society at San José Church is to serve God by caring for the altar needs of the Church. It maintains all altar linens and priestly vestments. It prepares and decorates the main altar of the Church for special liturgical celebrations such as Advent, Christmas, Lent, Holy Week, Easter and Pentecost. The group meets before major holidays at the call of the group’s leader. In 1940, a similar group called the Sanctuary Society donated $20 to the church (1).

An Altar Society was organized at San José Church in March 1975.  An announcement in the Sunday Bulletin announced the formation of an Altar Society with María Soliz and Herlinda Solis as its organizers (223:23/03/75). In 1975, the Sunday Bulletin was printed only in English without any attempt to translate any portion into Spanish. However, the following week, the Altar Society placed an announcement in the Sunday Bulletin in Spanish seeking members (223:30/03/75). In April, the Altar Society had its first meeting in the CCD Center. It was a Spanish speaking group (223:27/04/75).

Between 1987 and 1992, María Galvan was the sacristan. She was in charge of the sacristy and its contents. María Pérez washed the altar linens weekly and did other small jobs of this nature (223:05/07/1987). In July 1989, she provided the speaker covers for the new church (223:23/07/1989) and, in 1992, made curtains for the Sacred Heart Chapel. She continued to faithfully wash and iron the many purificators used at Mass every week (223:03/05/1992). A purificator is a white linen cloth used to wipe the chalice after each communicant partakes of the wine changed into blood. It is also used to wipe the chalice and paten following Communion.

## Catholic Adult Organization

### C.A.O.

Membership in the Catholic Youth Organization was open to high school students and young adults (209). When the young people of San José grew up and left school, some were reluctant to join existing adult organizations such as the Guadalupanas and the Socios. Those organizations were dominated by entrenched leaders who were often unwilling to relinquish control. The Guadalupanas and Socios, in particular, retained Mexican traditions and usages that were unfamiliar to children who came of age in the 1970s. As a result, some young adults at San José formed another organization called the Catholic Adult Organization (58). The Catholic Adult Organization was modeled after the Catholic Youth Organization with which the young adults were familiar.

The Catholic Adult Organization first appeared in December 1978. The Sunday Bulletin announced that its meetings were held on Wednesday evenings at the home of Frank and Mary Gonzales (223:03/12/78). Later, the group met every two weeks on Tuesday or Wednesday at the home of its members until the end of January when it was decided to move the meetings to 1:30PM on Sunday at the San José School (223:07/01/79) (223:28/01/79) (223:04/02/79) (223:01/04/79).

In September 1981, the C.A.O. sponsored a King or Queen candidate for the Fall Fiesta (223:20/09/1981) and operated a booth selling hamburgers at the Fall Fair on November 1 (223: 01/11/1981). Rudy Duran was listed as the contact person for the Catholic Adult Organization in 1981, 1982 and 1983 (223:07/06/1981) (223:27/06/82) (223:02/01/1983). The organization was dormant between 1983 and 1986.

### V.I.G.I.L.

When the organization of Young Adults reappeared in the fall of 1986, it was called either Young Adults of San José or V.I.G.I.L. (223:03/05/1987). A few years previously, the pastor, Rev. Fred Underwood, had organized the youth into affinity groups called Y.E.S., L.I.F.E. and J.O.Y. Each group wore a distinctive tee-shirt (in place of the insignia worn by more traditional sodalities). Probably for this reason, the Catholic Adults adopted V.I.G.I.L. as their insignia. V.I.G.I.L. was probably an acronym. (J.O.Y. is an acronym for Jesus Our Yearning).

V.I.G.I.L. was a discussion group. It met every Thursday from 7:00PM or 7:30PM until 9:00PM in the school building (223:14/09/1986) (223:04/01/1987) (223:04/10/1987). V.I.G.I.L. met at the same time as the prayer meeting in the church that was led by Francis Treviño. V.I.G.I.L. may have originated in the young adult prayer meeting that previously met at that time (223:03/05/1987).

On May 7, 1987, Carlos Coronado was invited to address the group (223:10/05/1987). Carlos Coronado was a long-time employee of the church who worked as a counselor. He was invited back in August (223:16/08/1987). Rev. Charles Van Winkle, C.S.C., was invited to discuss, “The True Nature of Love” (223:02/08/1987). Fr. Van Winkle is an author and inspiration speaker who lives at St. Edward’s University.

In addition to scripture sharing and discussion, the Young Adults sponsored volley ball games during the summer months (223:10/05/1987) and helped at the Austin Food Bank (223:12/07/1987). It actively recruited new members (223:15/11/1987) and encouraged them to become involved in their community. V.I.G.I.L. members helped Blue Santa wrap gifts for the needy (223:06/12/1987) and in December took Polaroid pictures of children with Santa in the Community Center (223:06/12/1987). The group sold Christmas Cookie Care Packages after each morning Mass on December 6 to benefit the building fund for the new church (223:06/12/1987).

Beginning on February 21, 1988, VIGIL Young Adult Group began meeting from 7:00PM until 9:00PM on Thursday in Room 2-B in the school building. The group met every week at that time and location for the remainder of 1988 (223). VIGIL sponsored a kids’ fun day for children aged 6 to 12 on Saturday afternoon, July 23 at the Community Center (223:17/07/1988).

In December 1988, VIGIL Young Adults met on Thursday at 7:00PM. They invited young people to help wrap gifts for Blue Santa on Saturday, December 10, from 10:00AM to 3:00PM. An insurance waiver will be required because it involved a trip. The waivers were available in the church foyer the week before (223:04/12/1988). The Young Adults sponsored a visit by Santa on December 18 in the old church (223:11/12/1988).

VIGIL met on Thursday at 7:00PM in the old church until April 13, 1989. The next week the time slot was occupied by the teaching portion of the 7:20PM Prayer Meeting that always met on Thursday nights. The Mass was moved to 8:00PM with a healing service at 8:30PM. Somewhere in this process, VIGIL disappeared, apparently absorbed into the prayer meeting (223:16/04/1989).

### Divorced and Single Parents

Divorced/Single Parents was a separate group that met on Monday evening at 7:30PM in the school beginning in March 1987 (223:13/09/1987). San José Parish held an Open House for Single and Divorced Parents (223:29/03/1987) in March. As a result of that outreach, a group called Divorced and Single Parents (223:12/04/1987) was created. The group held its organizational meeting on Monday, April 13 in the Religious Education Center (the school building) to elect officers. Membership was open to single parents, those who were divorced, separated and widowed and single Catholics over the age of 30 (223: 22/11/1987). In a time when every organization had its acronym, the group was known as S.C.O.T.S. (223: 21/02/1988).  

The group very sensibly arranged from babysitting during their Monday evening meetings. The baby setters were available for $0.50 per hour per child from 7:30PM until 9:00PM (223:07/06/1987). The group organized a picnic on Sunday, June 28 that was well attended (223:05/07/1987). In December the group invited all single, divorced and separated parents, widows and single Catholics over age 30 to a healing prayer service in the school after the 7:00PM Wednesday Mass (223: 22/11/1987). They invited a speaker from the Austin Diocese to their meeting on February 1988 (223: 21/02/1988) (223: 03/04/1988) and sponsored parenting classes in English and Spanish (223:26/06/1988).

## Catholic Youth Organization

The first Catholic Youth Organization (C.Y.O.) was formed by Bishop Bernard Sheil of Chicago in 1930 as an athletic association. Its purpose was to keep young men from engaging in criminal activity. Under Archbishop George Cardinal Mundelein, a core principal of C.Y.O. was to not discriminate on the basis of gender and the C.Y.O. became known for its highly competitive athletic contests for both boys and girls (CYO website).

The C.Y.O. was never a national organization. It was organized at the Diocesan level. Each Diocesan C.Y.O. was completely autonomous (Encyclopeadia Britannica). In 1957, the Diocese of Austin sponsored its first Diocesan Catholic Youth Conference (DCYC) (Diocesan Catholic Youth Conference website). Subsequently, twenty-seven C.Y.O. clubs were organized at various parishes of the Diocese, including one at San José (213).

A few dioceses in the United States still have C.Y.O. clubs, including the Archdiocese of San Antonio and the Diocese of Laredo. The C.Y.O. in San Antonio is a sports organization. The parent organization in the Diocese of Austin, the Diocesan DCYC, also still exists but not as a sports organization. The 60th Diocese of Austin DCYC took place in Waco, Texas in February 2018. Attendance was expected to be 2,800 persons (Diocesan Catholic Youth Conference website). The San José C.Y.O. club disappeared after 1984. It was replaced by various youth groups and, later, a Youth Support Group.

### CYO Begun,1960-1961

According to Pete Castillo, in the early 1960s, most of the teenage parishioners of San José Church attended Fulmore Junior High and Travis High School. Other than the CCD or Religious Education classes they were all required to attend, there was no contemporary parish organization specifically for teenagers. The Hijas de Maria were still active in 1961 but consisted of grade school girls (223:05/07/61). There was also a small group of Boys Scouts (223:03/19/61). The traditional young men’s group, Joventud Catolica, ceased to exist at San José Church sometime prior to 1960.

A group of teenagers and their parents proposed that the young people of San Jose would benefit from a C.Y.O. club. They proposed the idea to the pastor. The pastor initially opposed the idea but, with the encouragement of the Diocese DCYC, he agreed to organize a C.Y.O. in 1960 or 1961 (193).

The C.Y.O. was not a social club although it had social fiestas. C.Y.O. was a sodality whose main purpose was to promote religion or the spiritual life. In the C.Y.O., the youth learned obedience to God and parents (223:12/23/62). Its purpose was to provide wholesome and healthful recreational activities for the physical and spiritual well-being of the youth. Meetings were initially held once a week on Thursday (223:06/09/63) evenings and later on Mondays (223:07/16/67).

Although C.Y.O. had a priest who served as its moderator and adult volunteer sponsors who offered direction and guidance, the youth were totally responsible for carrying out their duties and responsibilities. Membership was open to high school students and young adults (209). Four or five members were elected to serve as officers. The officers, usually a President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer and later, a Sergeant at Arms, were elected in May (223:05/06/62) or August (223:08/09/70) of each year.

### CYO Softball, 1961-1962

San José C.Y.O. fielded a softball team in 1961. The team needed money to pay the entry fees of the Austin League so parishioners were invited to a breakfast after Sunday Mass that was for the benefit of the softball team (223:04/16/61). In the summer of 1962, the San Jose softball team was in first place in their league after the first half of the season (223:07/29/62).

### CYO Sports, 1963-1965

The number of sports teams sponsored by San José C.Y.O. varied over the years. In 1963, Sam Guerra coached a boys’ basketball team (223:03/03/63). The next year, a baseball team, known as the San José Champions, was formed to play against teams from other Austin Catholic Churches, such as Dolores and Guadalupe (223:05/17/64). The games were on Sunday afternoons (223:01/26/64).

San José C.Y.O. sports teams occasionally had winning seasons. The baseball team and two other teams from San José won championships in 1964 (223:06/14/64). The San José Hawks boys’ baseball team won the first half championship in the spring of 1965 (223:05/30/65). The C.Y.O. boys’ softball team won the Austin District Championship in 1969 but lost the Diocesan championship game to Brenham (223:07/13/69). In the fall of the year, the boys’ flag-football and the girls’ volleyball teams competed in the inter-parochial league against teams from other churches (223:10/03/65).

### CYO Dances, 1966

Of the two hundred or so high school students registered at San José in 1968, forty or fifty attended the weekly C.Y.O. meetings (223:01/14/68). In May 1966, San José C.Y.O. had 56 card-carrying members (223:08/05/66) (223:02/18/68). Not all of the C.Y.O. members played on a sports team and the group sponsored numerous other activities. Like other San José sodalities, the group raised money by selling cakes and other baked goods (223:02/16/64) (223:02/11/68) (223:07/21/68) (223:01/18/70).

The C.Y.O. District sponsored dances in a different venue about once every three months. The dances were usually in a parish hall (223:01/23/66) but were also held at the Newman Center at the University of Texas (223:08/20/67), at St. Edward’s University (223:11/12/67) and at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Zilker Park. The cost was often $0.75 or $1.00 with a C.Y.O. card and $1.25 without or $1.50 per couple (223:04/07/68).

San José C.Y.O. also sponsored dances with live bands in the San José Community Center (223:07/07/68) (223:10/05/69) and record hops in the San José School (223:07/06/69). In March 1968, the parish C.Y.O. staged a talent show (223:03/17/68) and on Friday, October 31 1969, the C.Y.O. sponsored an invitation only Halloween Party in the Youth Center from 8:00PM to 1:00AM (223:10/26/69). Like most youth events at San José, the price of entry was low (223:03/17/68). Tickets for C.Y.O. dances were typically $1.50 per person (223:10/05/69).

The C.Y.O. encouraged its members to participate in religious life. In January 1967, Fr. Houser challenged the members of C.Y.O. to make a Holy Hour on First Friday, to assist at Mass as servers and to receive Holy Communion weekly (223:01/22/67). In December 1965, individual members of the C.Y.O. and Cursillistas worked many hours decorating the Church (223:12/26/65) and, in 1967, C.Y.O. members offered to baby sit small children in the school during the 10:00AM Mass beginning on July 30, 1967 (223:07/23/67). On July 21, 1969, the weekly C.Y.O. meeting was cancelled because all the boys were expected to work on repairs to the Youth Recreation Center, the old hall barrack (223:07/13/69). C.Y.O. members also helped out with the adult education classes on Tuesday and Wednesday where English as a Second Language was taught (223:02/18/68).

### CYO's Golden Age, 1967

While Rev. Michael (Mike) Mikan, C.S.C. was Assistant Pastor, from 1967 until 1975, youth activities at San Jose Church were said to have entered a “Golden Age” (12). C.Y.O. met Monday nights at 7:30PM following CCD classes (223:07/16/67) and Fr. Mikan expected 40-50 students to attend each meetings (223:01/14/68). Rev. Haley told a reporter that that C.Y.O. was among the seventh largest organizations at San José Church (122).

San José C.Y.O. members were also active in the Diocesan DCYC, the annual diocesan youth convention. In 1967, eleven students from San José attended the Diocesan Convention (223:07/30/67) and sixteen attended the convention in 1969 (213). In December 1967, three C.Y.O. members from San José ran for offices in the District C.Y.O. (223:12/03/67) and Miss Beede Saenz of San José was elected President of the Austin District C.Y.O. (213).

### Youth Center, 1970

CCD classes in the school at 7:00PM were followed by meetings of C.Y.O. at 8:00PM in the new Youth Center (233:03/01/70) (223:04/05/70). The Youth Center was located in a barrack that had been renovated the previous fall by the men and boys of the parish for that purpose. Fifty to sixty young people attended the meetings and participated in the club’s activities in 1970 (223:04/26/70). C.Y.O. sponsored a dance in June and made a profit of $246 (213). The club had $500 in the bank (223:04/26/70) and was able to pay for a picnic at City Park and a trip to Six Flags for 50 of its members (223: 26/01/70) (223:08/02/70). In 1970, the San José boys’ baseball team was the defending league champions (213) (223:04/26/70).

In July, the San José C.Y.O. club was voted “the best club of 1969” by the twenty-seven C.Y.O. clubs in the Diocese (213) during the Diocesan C.Y.O. convention (223:07/12/70). When the C.Y.O. District Convention met at San José in November, San José C.Y.O. received two awards (223:11/22/70). During this time, Fr. Mike Mikan was in charge of the C.Y.O. (223:09/05/70).     

### District Champions, 1971

In February 1971, San José C.Y.O. organized volleyball and basketball teams (213). Both teams went to the finals (223:02/28/71) and in July the C.Y.O. girls’ team won the Austin District softball tournament (223:07/11/71).

The C.Y.O. continued to meet in the Youth Center at 7:00PM, followed by CCD classes at 7:30PM in the school (223:03/07/71). CCD classes met from September to May and were suspended for the summer. The C.Y.O. met on Monday nights at 7:00PM in the Youth Center throughout the summer months with over fifty young people in attendance (223:06/13/71). C.Y.O. sponsored dances for C.Y.O. members and their invited friends in February, May, June and August (213). Profits from the dances allowed the C.Y.O. to donate $730 to install carpeting in the church sanctuary and $500 to help the parish purchase a station wagon (213) (223:07/18/71). In March, the young men of C.Y.O. worked with older men to install the carpet in the church (223:03/21/71). During 1971, the group spent $1,500.00 to rewire and improve the Youth Center (223: 13/02/72).

C.Y.O. helped with a South Austin clean up drive in May (223:04/25/71) (223:06/13/71) and sponsored the candidacy of Gloria Buentello for Queen of the Fiesta de Colores (213). Members attended District and State C.Y.O. meetings in San Marcos and College Station (213) and the club sent fifty members on a trip to Six Flags in June (223:06/13/71). To raise funds, members washed cars for $1 per car from 10:00AM to 4:00PM on a Saturday (223:07/18/71) and sold baked goods after Sunday Mass (223: 03/10/71). In October, they sold candy after the 10:00AM and 12:00PM Masses to raise money for “one of our high school students who intends to go to college” (223: 24/10/71). New officers, four out of five of them women, were elected in September (223: 05/09/71).           

### Sweethearts, 1972

C.Y.O. continued to meet on Monday at 7:00PM at the Youth Center. Their first fund raiser of the year, on Saturday, January 15, 1972, was a dance to raise money for a Holy Cross missionary in Bangladesh (223: 16/01/72). In February and March, C.Y.O. had bake sales after Sunday morning Masses (223: 05/03/72).

The club decided to sponsor a Sweetheart Candidate at the church bazaar that took place in May (223: 05/03/72). This was a major commitment. In early March, C.Y.O. held a cake sale and bicycle raffle for Miss Maggie Trejo, their candidate for Queen. Two weeks later, they announced in the Sunday Bulletin that they were offering to do odd jobs for parishioners with all proceeds going to their candidate for Sweetheart, Miss Trejo (223: 12/03/72). Four organizations sponsored Sweetheart Candidates in 1972: the Guadalupanas sponsored Miss Sylvia Segura; the Socios sponsored Miss Lolly Vargas; the PTA sponsored Miss Cindy Ortiz and the C.Y.O. sponsored Miss Maggie Trejo (223: 12/03/72). Competition to raise the most money was fierce. In April, Miss Trejo sponsored a “Lockhart Sausage Dinner” at the Community Center on April 9 from 11:00AM to 5:00PM (the cost was $1.25 per adult and $0.75 for children) followed by a Baile Ranchero from 3:00PM to 7:00PM with Los Alegres Del Sur band (tickets were $1.50 per person) and a teen dance from 8:00PM-midnight with the Mike Saucedo band (tickets were $2 per person) (223:09/04/72).

C.Y.O. also managed four booths at the annual church bazaar in May and earned $280 for the church (223:21/05/72). The club had a scholarship fund of $800 that was open to any high school senior who was a member of the parish and who wished to attend college (223:04/06/72). In July, scholarships were awarded to Miss Sylvia Luna ($300); Miss Carmen Castillo ($300); Edward Esquivel ($200); Joe Sosa ($200); Miss Terri Estrada ($150) and Richard Moreno ($150) (223:16/07/72). The club had enough money to hire a bus for a trip to Six Flags in San Antonio in July (223:16/07/72).

### Tutors, 1973

C.Y.O. continued to meet on Monday nights at 7:30PM (249:02/12/73). In August new officers, all young women, were elected to fill the offices of President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer (248:26/08/73).

In September, the C.Y.O. and CCD announced that tutors would be available in the school library from 4:00PM to 9:00PM every Tuesday to help high school students with their homework (248: 09/10/73). In November, a free clinic opened at the Youth Center on Monday nights from 7:00PM to 9:00PM with Dr. Ben White attending to children and Dr. Van Weisse attending adults (249: 04/11/73).

### Neighborhood Youth Corps, 1974

In February 1974, a girls’ basketball team (the Chompers) formed. Coaches were Ms. Thelma Ruano and Ms. Hilda Ruano. The team consisted of Rosie Martinez, Captain; Dee Dee Perez, co-Capitan; Janie Maldonado, Yolie Maldonado, Monica Salazar, Angie Castillo, Martha Castillo, Christine Ruiz, Lily Martinez and Maria Buentello (249: 24/02/74).

During 1974, C.Y.O. met at 7:00PM on Wednesday in the San José School (250:15/12/74) (223:05/01/75). The club met in the school because, beginning in January, their clubhouse, the Youth Center, was open to the public on Wednesday from 5:00PM to 9:00PM with games and food (249:20/01/74).

During 1974, two young women were hired to manage the South Austin Recreation Center that was temporarily located in a barrack in the School Compound. The Neighborhood Youth Corps, a government agency, funded the project (249:23/06/74). During the summer of 1974, events for teens were a regular feature at the South Austin Recreation Center and the San Jose Community Center. Usually 40 teens participated in the various events (249:16/06/74). There was no mention of the involvement of C.Y.O. in these events but, by all appearances, the C.Y.O., the Neighbor Youth Corps and the staff of a newsletter called the Samaritan were the same people. These events are described in greater detail in the article on the San José Community Center.

Young people at San José Parish were also involved in a mission to Mexico. The mission group raised funds at San José (249:21/04/74) and in June, thirty persons (about half from San Jose and the other half from Dolores Parish) left to travel to San Rafael Parish, south of Saltillo in Coahuila, Mexico. The purpose of the trip was to teach religion in a parish that had no priest (249: 09/06/74). The mission is described in the article dealing with Dolores Parish.

In August forty-eight teenagers and their chaperons went on a day trip to Six Flags in San Antonio (249:21/07/74). In November, C.Y.O. prepared and served a Mexican dinner to raise funds (250:12/09/74). Tickets were sold at the church entrance for $1.75 for adults and $1.25 for children (250:03/11/74). On December 7, C.Y.O. showed movies for grammar school children in the hall for 25 cents from 1:00PM to 3:00PM (250:24/11/74).

### Bazaar Clowns, 1975

C.Y.O. continued to meet at San Jose School on Wednesday nights at 7:30PM (223:05/02/75). New officers, all young women, were elected in May (237). In September, the officers were reorganized and a new position, Sargent at Arms, was created (223:14/09/75). C.Y.O. officers met at 6:00PM on Tuesday prior to the meeting of the members on Wednesday (223:13/04/75).

Although the club focused less on sports than in the past, there was a meeting in March of girls interested in playing basketball (223:16/03/75). The boys already had a basketball team that was outfitted with jerseys (223:23/03/75). The teenagers challenged the CCD high school teachers, who were young adults, to a volleyball game in March (223:16/03/75).

The club raised money in various ways. In April, C.Y.O. sold tickets to a chalupa dinner that was served in the Community Center (223:27/04/75). Tickets were 35 cents (223:04/05/75). The dinner was announced in the Sunday Bulletin (223:18/05/75). In July, they sponsored a car wash at Ramirez Texaco Station, 2215 South Congress. The cost was $1.00 per car (223:20/07/75). In October, the C.Y.O. sponsored movies in the Community Center with popcorn, punch and cookies for 25 cents (223:05/10/75).

C.Y.O. sponsored a skating party in March (223:02/03/75) and went to Landa Park on Saturday, June 14 with a group from Cristo Rey (223:08/06/75). In August, the club sponsored its annual trip to Six Flags amusement park in San Antonio (223:10/08/75).   

C.Y.O. managed five booths at the May 4 San Jose Church Bazaar. The booths were called Dart Booth, Plate Booth, Jail House Booth, Marriage Booth and Duck Booth. They were game booths.  In addition to managing the five booths, thirteen members of the club dressed and performed as clowns during the bazaar (237).	 

### Mission to El Castillo, 1976

During 1976, C.Y.O. met after CCD classes for 9-12th graders on Mondays at 8:00PM. Anyone who was in the 8th grade and through 12th grade could join the club (223:21/03/76) but membership was limited to high school students and recent high school graduates (223:06/06/76). A new slate of officers was elected in May with Paul Gonzalez moving from Treasurer to President (223:30/05/76). Two of the four offices were held by women. In 1976, the 20th annual C.Y.O. Convention for the Diocese of Austin was held in College Station and four young people from San José attended (223:11/07/76). On July 25, San José C.Y.O. hosted the monthly meeting of the District Board (223:25/07/76).

As in the previous year, C.Y.O. was involved in the mission to Mexico of which Paul Gonzalez was a leader. From June 10 until June 31, thirty-five youth volunteers from Dolores and San José Churches traveled to El Castillo, a mission of San Rafael, SLP, as missionaries (119). The C.Y.O. sponsored eight booths at the May 2 church bazaar (223:02/05/76).

On a Saturday in June, C.Y.O. screened movies at the Community Center for 25 cents per person (223:13/06/76). The tickets were mailed to the homes of children invited to attend. The two-hour show began at 10:00AM and was repeated at noon (223:20/06/76). The C.Y.O. gave the Associate Pastor, Rev. Larry Bauer, four checks totaling $250 to help the altar boys, the children’s’ choir and other parish organizations (223:04/07/76).

### San Jose Reds, 1978

C.Y.O. met in the school on Monday night (223:10/09/76). The Sunday Bulletin informed parishioners when and where the C.Y.O. baseball team, called the San José Reds, was scheduled to play (223:08/10/78). New officers were elected and a sixth position, a Reporter, was added to the list of officers. Five of the six officers were young women (223:11/11/78).

### Mission to Ahuacatlan, 1979

C.Y.O. sponsored softball teams for both boys and girls in 1979 (12). The C.Y.O. basketball team won a trophy at the Cristo Rey invitational basketball tournament (223:11/03/79) and, in April, the San Jose team played six games at various locations against teams named the Law Rollers, Granfalloon, HRSB, Questions, Aloha Pools and Coopers Bloopers (223:08/04/79).

C.Y.O. maintained its program of religious, social and apostolic activities. Its summer volunteer program sent teams of C.Y.O. members to El Castillo and then Ahuacatlán in Mexico (12). The regular C.Y.O. meeting was Sunday at 7:00PM (223:04/02/79). The club continued to raise funds by selling cakes after 8:00AM, 10:00AM and 12:00PM Sunday Masses (223:04/02/79).

### Lock-in,1981

Alice Maldonado and Sandra Polanco were the contacts for C.Y.O. in 1981 (223:07/06/1981). They were probably the C.Y.O. President and Vice President. The club continued to field sports teams. The San José baseball team, known as the Reds, played its games at Krieg Fields in South Austin (223:05/07/1981). In the fall of the year, San Jose C.Y.O. put together a volleyball team and placed second in the district C.Y.O. volleyball tournament (223: 15/11/1981).

In June, the pastor, Rev. John Korcsmar, convened a meeting with social workers, parents and teens to discuss and suggest ways to improve the youth program (223:07/06/1981). One result was that the parish sponsored a lock-in for teenagers in the Community Center on Saturday, June 13. The lock-in was cancelled because of a rainstorm. The Teen Prayer Group held a Watermelon Prayer Meeting at the San Jose Community Center on July 1 (223:28/06/1981) and the Lock-In was rescheduled for July 25. All teens were invited to participate in the lock-in at the school that began at 10:00PM and continued until 7:00AM the next morning (223:19/07/1981).

To celebrate Halloween, C.Y.O. built a Spook House that was open to the public on Friday and Saturday evenings. Alice Maldonado was in charge of the Spook House (223: 04/10/1981).

### 1982

Alice Maldonado and Roberta Moreno were listed in the Sunday Bulletin as the contact persons for the Catholic Youth Organization (223:27/06/82). The group no longer met weekly. In 1982, the club met on the First Sunday of each month at 1:30PM (223:11/07/82). The San José Reds Softball Team won their league trophy under the direction of their coach, Ray Treviño. The team was first organized 1977 and fielded a team each year (223:17/10/82).

### YES, LIFE, JOY, 1983-1984

Alice Maldonado and Roberta Moreno were listed in the Sunday Bulletin as the contact persons for the C.Y.O. in 1983 (223:02/01/1983). In February,1984, San José hosted the Diocesan C.Y.O. meeting. The meeting included mass and a dance to which high school and junior high school youth over 13 were invited to attend. The pastor warned that, “Membership Cards will be checked!” (223:12/02/84). In 1984, the Diocesan Youth convention, held in La Grange, was called the Diocesan Youth Spectacular 1984. The convention took place on a Sunday afternoon in April with a group of C.Y.O. members leaving San Jose at 12:15PM and returning at 10:00PM (223:01/04/84).

When Rev. Fred Underwood became pastor, the nature of the youth program changed. C.Y.O. was gradually displaced by other groups. At a retreat on April 22-24, 1983, eighty-nine youth “made a serious commitment to Jesus”. They also committed to attend an extra Mass during the week. The group chose to attend daily Mass on Tuesday at 7:00PM in addition to Mass on Sunday. (High school CCD attended the same Mass). The Sunday Youth Choir agreed to sang at the Mass. A meeting followed the Mass (223:01/05/83). This became the Y.E.S. Youth Group. Freshmen in high school and older including young adults to age 30 were invited to join (223:01/05/83).

All public school students were already required to attend a weekly Mass and religious education or CCD class. In 1984, Junior High School students attended Mass on Wednesday at 7:00PM and then religious education class afterward. Senior High School students went to Mass on Tuesday and then attended CCD class (223:27/01/1985). In February 1984, senior high school and junior high school youth purchased “identifying tee-shirts”. The high school logo was L.I.F.E. and the junior high logo was J.O.Y., both of which were acronyms (223:119/02/84).

C.Y.O. members belonged to all three affinity groups (Y.E.S., L.I.F.E. and J.O.Y.). Events that were previously C.Y.O. events became Y.E.S., L.I.F.E. or J.O.Y. events. For example, the church sponsored a skating party for the L.I.F.E. Group, J.O.Y. Group and Young Adults (Y.E.S.) at the skating rink on Stassney Lane on a Sunday in March (223:04/03/84). L.I.F.E. and J.O.Y. members formed a softball team (223:01/04/84) that practiced on Saturday and Sunday afternoons (223:29/04/84).

In May, L.I.F.E. and J.O.Y. and Young Adult groups were invited to an event called the May Fest Youth Dance. “There is no admission fee. Please present your I.D. Card” (223:29/04/84). The pastor expected all 350 participants in the three youth groups would also be card-carrying C.Y.O. members (223:01/04/84).

In addition to organizing the three youth groups, Fr. Underwood recruited the most promising C.Y.O.-aged young people into a Youth Renewal Team to help with the Parish Renewal program. He organized three Mission Teams of 25 to 30 persons each (223:01/04/84). One was a Youth Renewal Team. Underwood scheduled a Parish Renewal at San José about once a month for several years and traveled extensively to present Parish Renewals to other parishes. The Youth Renewal Team went to Eagle Pass on May 26, 1984 to present a Renewal there (223:27/05/84). The team was a separate sodality and planned its own social events. The team and their sponsors went to Astroworld on July 14 (223:01/07/84). Rudy Duran, Tony Moreno, Paul Samaniego, Joe Maldonado, Mike Calderon and Steve Mireles provided the transportation for the trip to San Antonio (223:22/07/84). The youth were also in charge of Adoration on First Friday from 10:00PM to 11:00PM (223:29/04/84).

In March 1984, the parish decided to purchase of a school bus (223:25/03/84). The parish ordered a new school bus (subsequently named the Spirit of San Jose) from Carpenter in San Antonio. The cost of the bus was $27,334 plus tax, title and license (223:20/05/84). Having ordered the bus, the next step was to raise the necessary funds. The C.Y.O. decided to sell snow-cones to help pay for the bus. Beginning in May, the youth group sold snow cones after 9:30AM, 11:00AM and 12:30PM Masses each Sunday for several months (223:13/05/84). They raised $80 the first week (223:20/05/84) and $150 the second week (223:27/05/84). In mid-June, they raised $117 at the weekly sale of snow-cones (223:24/06/84). Those who worked on the snow-cone sales were given a 50% discount on a June 30 trip to Schlitterbahn Water Park (223:24/06/84).

When the bus was placed in service in August, the total cost was $29,365.30 (223:12/08/84). Most of the money came from outside the parish, but the young people had raised $1,370 by selling snow-cones (223:19/08/84). Thereafter, summer snow-cones sales became a tradition at San José that lasted until about 2015.The new bus was used for the first time to take the youth group on a trip to San Antonio (223:12/08/84).

### The Youth, 1985

After 1984, the Catholic Youth Organization (C.Y.O.) at San José underwent a change of name. The club continued to sponsor activities but the name was not used after 1987. The C.Y.O. was referred to as the Youth Program, Youth Group or, simply, Youth. Often, the Sunday Bulletin referred to “youth” without providing other details. All of these may refer to the C.Y.O. The 29th Annual Diocesan C.Y.O. Convention was held at the Marriott Hotel in Austin but it is unclear if anyone from San José attended. The cost was $65 per person (223:30/06/1985).

Around this time, the San Jose parish community became involved in a national youth conference that took place every year at a Catholic university in Steubenville, Ohio. In July 1985, forty-one teenagers and adults left on the church bus for the 10th Annual Youth Conference in Steubenville, Ohio. They were gone for four days (223:21/07/1985).

The new church bus provided transportation to a variety of youth events (223: 05/05/1985). In January, the Sunday Bulletin announced a bus trip to Aquarena Springs in San Marcos (223:13/01/1985). The two youth groups (L.I.F.E. and J.O.Y.) had social events throughout the summer months. These included a dance on May 3, roller skating on May 5, a field trip to Inks Lake on May 11 and a field trip to Schlitterbahn Water Amusement Park on May 25 (223:28/04/1985).

In September, the Youth Program sponsored a field trip to San Antonio for Junior and Senior High Youth Group members. There was no charge for the bus trip (223:22/09/1985). In December, the Youth Group sponsored a Special Youth Christmas field trip to San Antonio to Wittig Museum and the River Walk from 2:00PM to 10:00PM. The bus ride was free (223:15/12/1985).

Other activities included sporting events and dances. Softball practice began on Tuesday nights in May (223:26/05/1985) and dances were scheduled for Valentine’s Day in February and on March 22. The Valentine’s Day dance was free and Youth Group members from other parishes were invited to attend (223:27/01/1985). The dance in March was a fund raiser. One-half of the proceeds went to the Mexican mission and the other half to African Famine Relief (223:17/03/1985).  

During the summer school vacation, from May 12 until August 25, the Youth sold snow-cones after the 9:30AM and 11:00AM Sunday Masses and donated the money to the church (223: 26/05/1985). The income was listed in the Sunday Bulletin each week and ranged from $25 to $75. Income from the snow-cone sale was usually around $50 per week. When the summer school vacation ended around August 25, the snow-cones sales also ended (223:09/06/1985).

### Trip to Steubenville, 1986

The Youth Program continued to sponsor sporting teams in 1986. The Youth-sponsored basketball team played in the Deanery Basketball Tournament at Martin Junior High (223: 02/02/1986). Softball practice began in May (223: 04/05/1986) and the volleyball team began playing games in July (223: 13/07/1986) (223: 17/08/1986). The volleyball season ended with a tournament at San José on Sunday, October 26 (223:26/10/1986).

The parish was again planning to send young adults and teenagers to Franciscan University at Steubenville, Ohio for the National Conference for Young Adults (223:11/05/1986). Thirty-five people signed up for the trip (223: 20/07/1986) and, in August, thirty-four teenagers, young adults and adults traveled to Steubenville, Ohio (1,400 miles each way) in the church bus (223:10/08/1986).

Young people from San José attended other events nearer to home as well. Fifty youth group members and Catechists attended the Youth Christian Conference in Waco in August (223: 24/08/1986). They traveled in the parish church bus. A tiny photo of the group was reproduced in the Sunday Bulletin (223:31/08/1968). To finance the trip, the youth sold snow-cones after the 9:30AM, 11:00AM and 12:30PM Masses. The profits from the snow-cone sale were $120 on the first week (223:07/10/1968) and later averaged about $65 per week (223:14/09/1968).

Vans were used to carry youth group members to a Youth Spectacular in Rockdale on a Sunday in November. The event began at 11:00AM and ended at 10:30PM (223:26/10/1986). The event was sponsored by the Diocese (223:02/11/1986). The chaperones who accompanied the teenagers were Steve Mireles, Rudy Duran, Dan Villegas and Tom Soto (223:23/11/1986).

In June, youth group members and altar servers went to Schlitterbahn Water Amusement Park. Tickets were $9.50 per person including the cost of the bus (223: 08/06/1986). In October, youth group members were invited to a camping trip to Inks Lake near Buchanan Dam (223:12/10/1968).

### 1987

The Deanery Basketball Tournament was in February at Martin Junior High but there was no mention that San José sent a team (223:08/02/1987). However, someone (possible Mike Calderon) was still running a sports program at San José. The softball team practiced each Tuesday at 7:30PM ahead of its first game on May 5 (223:26/04/1987). Intermural volleyball and basketball was played at San Jose every Saturday at noon (223:10/05/1987). San José fielded basketball and baseball teams. The basketball finals were played at St. Ignatius church (223: 01/11/1987) and the San José team practiced on the church grounds on Saturday from 10:00AM to noon to prepare. The San José boys’ baseball team won second place in their league (223:22/11/1987).

For the third time, the parish sent a busload of teenagers and their chaperones to Ohio. The youth paid for the trip by selling snow-cones from May (223:03/05/1987) until the end of August (223:30/08/1987). They also sold breakfast in May and sponsored several dances in the Community Center. The dances made enough money to finance the trip to Steubenville, Ohio, to send some young adults to a Spiritual Leaders Conference and Workshop in New Orleans (223:26/07/1987), to pay for an item for the new church and to pay for the Video Projector being used for their Sunday evening CCD classes (223: 25/10/1987).

A large group of teenagers traveled to “The Lord’s Ranch” near El Paso on March 14-21 (223:01/03/1987). A group photo of thirty-three persons appeared in the Sunday Bulletin. They all wore identical tee shirts bearing the words, “San Jose C.Y.O” and an image of the crucifix of the Risen Christ that is still displayed in the church (223:29/03/1987). During the summer of 1987, a busload of youth went to Schlitterbahn twice (223:07/06/1987) (223:16/08/1987).

### 1988

Angela Álvarez, Danny Rodriguez and Mike Calderon put together a coed softball team for San José (223:08/05/1988) (223:22/05/1988). The team practiced at the South Austin Recreation Center at South 5th and Cumberland Streets (223:05/06/1988) and traveled to their games in the church bus (223:26/06/1988). The team won the tournament in June, beating teams from St. Louis, St. Anthony and St. Catherine of Sienna churches. San José teenagers on the all-star team were Raquel Fuentes and James Gomez. David Pérez, Anna Rodriguez, JoAnne Calderon and Manuel Rodriguez were alternates. Mike Calderon was the team leader (223:03/07/1988) (223:17/07/1988). The next tournament was on July 24 in Taylor (223:17/07/1988).      

### Youth Support Group

In March 1987, Sister Eva Walsh led a weekend retreat for children aged 13 to 19 whose parents were dead or divorced (223:01/03/1987). This was probably how the Youth Support Group originated. In May, the Youth Support Group began to meet on Wednesday, immediately following the 7:00PM Mass.

The support group met for prayer, counseling, scripture sharing and song. The group met from 7:30 to 8:30PM on Wednesday night. This was the time slot previously occupied by the Junior High School CCD (223:03/05/1987). When CCD began in September 1987, all CCD classes were moved to Sunday. The Youth Support Group took this time slot for their meetings (223: 20/09/1987) (223).

The Youth Support Group met on Wednesday from 7:30PM to 9:00PM during 1988 in Room 2B of the school building. During the summer of 1988, teens were invited to study scripture, share their faith and have fun at this event (223:12/06/1988). Youth Group members who had attended the Leadership Week Retreat in San Antonio assumed the leadership of the support group and expanded the group’s activities to include visits to a nursing home (223:26/06/1988).

The Youth Support Group met on 7:00PM on Wednesday in the old church in 1989 (223:01/01/1989). On March 26, the name was changed to Youth Sharing Group (223:26/03/1989). The Youth Sharing Group did not meet during the summer and the announcement in the Sunday Bulletin was taken down after September 3, 1989 (223:03/09/1989).

### Dances

The Youth Group sponsored a benefit dance for teenagers, ages 13 to 18, from 8:00PM to 11:30PM on a Friday in May 1988 in the parish hall. Parents were urged to pick-up their children before 11:30PM. Music was by “Delightful Sounds” by DJ Rudy Duran, Jr. and the cost was $3 per person. The maximum number of attendees was capped at 400 (223:15/05/1988). Prior to this dance, the parish usually held separate dances for Middle School and High School students. Apparently, the parish experimented with a joint dance for all teenagers in April and was satisfied with the results. The only caveat was that attendance was capped at 400. (The maximum capacity of the Community Center was 450 persons). Most teen dances after 1987 employed DJs instead of bands (223: 01/05/1988).

Between May and December 1988, the Sunday Bulletin announced eight dances for teenagers, most sponsored by the parish. In 1989, twelve teen dances were announced in the bulletin and in 1990 sixteen teen dances were announced in the bulletin. After 1990, the number of teen dance declined precipitously to four in 1991, three in 1992 and none in 1993. Dances at San José for adults suffered a similar but less severe decline. In August 1992, the pastor announced that so-called adult dances (where beer was served) had ended. Nevertheless, six adult dances were announced in 1993 to celebrate Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Halloween, Christmas and New Year. The sudden decline in the number of teen dances at San Jose may have been related to the change in day for teen dances from Friday to Sunday nights (223:15/04/1990) but that decision was made in the face of already declining attendance and was quickly reversed.

Perhaps another explanation for the decline in teen dances was the increasing involvement of the young people of San José in Rev. Underwood’s religious program.   
In September 1989, the pastor and the new Youth Director, Roberto Rojo, announced a new program for youth with three elements: Spiritual Renewal for Youth (formation of Youth Renewals, Youth Prayer Meeting and a Youth Evangelization Team); the Sacrament of Confirmation (the preparation for confirmation will teach about “inner strength”) and Youth Evangelization Outreach (to Meadowbrook Nursing Home). A fourth priority was to develop a Youth Center at San Jose (223:17/09/1989).

### Community Service Night

A parish renewal was presented on July 25, 1992, with the theme, “You are called to Evangelize (to share Christ with others)”. The renewal was aimed at CCD teachers, Census volunteers, youth in adopt a Grandmother/Grandfather Program and people involved in ministry (223:19/07/1992).

The Pastor called a meeting on August 4, 1992 of youth and adults who would volunteer to visit an elderly person in a nursing home once a week to become friends and eventually lead them to a personal encounter with Jesus (223:02/08/1992). The program was called “Adopt a Grandmother/Grandfather Program.” Participants agreed to visit nursing homes on 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month (223:16/08/1992) (223:23/08/1992) (223:13/09/1992) (223:18/10/1992) (01/11/1992). Confirmation students were encouraged to participate (223:15/11/1992).

The 11:00AM Choir and the Adopt a Grandmother/Grandfather Program went caroling on Saturday, Dec. 19 (223:06/12/1992). The Adopt-a-Grandmother/Grandfather Program and the 11:00AM Choir was planning to sing Christmas Carols at two nursing homes (223:05/12/1993).

A reminder appeared in the Sunday Bulletin in May 1993 asking people to “make a commitment in 1993 to share Christ with others” by visiting nursing homes on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month (223:02/05/1993) (223:16/05/1993). This counted as community service for confirmation candidates (223:12/09/1993).

### Trips

After the parish purchased a 54-passenger school bus, trips became more frequent. The youth program at San Jose sponsored youth trips to Inks Lake State Park (223:10/07/1988), McKinney Falls State Park (223:26/02/89), Schlitterbahn Water Park (223:30/07/1989) (223:23/06/1991) and a ranch in Georgetown (223:20/05/1990) during 1988, 1989 and 1990. These trips were never without cost and were accompanied by adult chaperons so the numbers of participants was limited to 45 or 47 persons. The parish also sent the Youth Core Group and adult sponsors to St. Theresa’s Church for training sponsored by the Diocese (223:29/01/89).

### Sports

The sports program continued under a variety of sponsors and coaches. San José fielded a basketball team under Mike Calderon (223:22/01/1989) (223:29/01/89), a baseball team for ages 8 through 14 years under Eddie Medel (223:13/05/1990) (223:20/05/1990) and two volleyball teams (223:01/03/1992). Hector and Zita Hernandez helped with the youth program (233:09/05/1993).

The sports program used the City-owned facilities at South Austin Recreation Center on 1100 Cumberland Street (223:01/03/1992). There students from San Jose played against other teams (223:11/08/1991) (223:01/03/1992) and practiced under adult supervision and training (223:12/07/1992). Sometimes, the children were invited to a Fun Day of basketball, volleyball, games, cokes, popcorn, etc. behind the school (223:19/11/1989) or at the South Austin Recreation Center (223:21/04/1991). In 1992, Monday night was San Jose night at the South Austin Recreation Center with softball, volleyball and basketball from 6PM to 10PM (223:12/07/1992).

Other youth activities during the summer included Bible Sharing on Monday from 6:00PM to 7:00PM; S.U.A.V.E. meetings on 1st Wednesday of each month and the Prayer Meeting on Thursday from 6:00PM to 9:00PM (223:28/04/1991). On one occasion, the church sponsored a Fun Night for middle and high school youth from 8:00PM until midnight in the old church with games, movies and other activities (223:12/07/1992).

### Martial Arts

In April 1989, the Sunday Bulletin announced a new program in Martial Arts beginning April 6 with weekly classes on Thursday and Saturday. There were seven instructors. The pastor said, “You won’t have to join a gang for security anymore” (223:02/04/89). The last announcement for the karate class appeared in the bulletin of July 2, 1989 (223:02/07/1989) and then reappeared on October 8. The classes were changed to Wednesday from 7:00PM until 8:30PM (223:08/10/1989). The karate class continued to meet in the old church at least until the end of 1993 (223) (223:07/01/1990) (223:01/07/1990) (223:14/04/1991) (223:26/12/1993). Benny Limón was instructor (223:08/07/1990).

The Martial Arts Program at San Jose was described as a Christian alternative for youth to join instead of joining a gang and an alternate for present gang members to leave the gangs (223:11/11/1990). In February 1992, the San José Karate Club conducted test promotions with instructors Benny Limon and Carlos D. Botello. The tester was Master William Moses Jr. of the Fire Dragon Martial Arts Academy. The following students were promoted: John Degollado, Dominic Frausto, Carlos Gutierrez, Jose Gutierrez, Jacob Perez, Pete Saucedo, Kilan Zamarripa, Zarla Samarripa, Joe Zapata, Pat Garcia, Trey Sifuentes and Albert Terrazas (223:09/02/1992).

### S.U.A.V.E.                           

S.U.A.V.E. members were high school students enrolled in CCD (223:13/10/1991). S.U.A.V.E. met on Wednesday at 7:00PM and Thursday at 6:00PM in the old church beginning in 1990. To raise funds they sold snow cones after all Masses and had a garage sale on June 24 (223:17/06/1990). Mr. Estrada, Mr. and Mrs. Molina and Mr. Romo helped sell the snow cones (223:29/07/1990). The Suave Youth Group and the Altar Servers took turns selling snow cones in 1990 (223:12/08/1990) (223:19/08/1990) (223:26/08/1990).

The group met throughout the summer on the first of Wednesday of each month and the pastor encouraged them to attend the Thursday Night Prayer Meeting as well (223:28/04/1991). The group held three fundraisers on consecutive Sundays in July 1991. They sold snow cones and baked goods after all Masses one week (223:07/07/1991), had a garage sale and bake sale the next Sunday and a car wash on the third Sunday (223:21/07/1991). The car wash was behind the old church (223:28/07/1991). The Sunday Bulletin reported this as a SUAVE fundraiser with proceeds of $233.46 (223:04/08/1991).

### Lock-in

A lock-in is a type of indoor camping trip. The participants gather on Friday night and leave for home on Saturday morning. Those sponsored by San José Parish during 1991 and 1992 began after the children had eaten supper and apparently ended after breakfast. A lock-in for middle school students was announced for 7th and 8th graders from 8:00PM Friday until 8:00AM Saturday on December 17 in the old church. The cost was $3. Each student provided a sleeping bag, pillow and a snack to share (223:02/12/1990). The Lock-In for high school students was on February 8 and 9 (223:13/01/1991) (223:03/02/1991). A similar event called, “End of School Lock-in” was scheduled for May 31- June 1 (223:05/19/1991).

In August 1992, all high school-aged teens were invited to a lock-in on Saturday night in the old church from 9PM Saturday to 9AM Sunday, followed by Mass at 9:30AM. The cost was $3 per person (223:02/08/1992). The Saturday night lock-in must have had problems because in October, when all 5th and 6th graders were invited to a lock-in, it was on Friday night. (223:04/10/1992). A Junior High Lock-In took place on Friday, November 20 (223:15/11/1992).

### Tutoring

Beginning in 1989, the parish launched a series of events to encourage children to stay in school. The Sunday Bulletin announced a series of classes, “Where there is a will, there’s an A” beginning on Easter Monday 1989 in the old church (223:26/03/89). Beginning in September 1990, a series called San José Adult Workshops were held on Wednesday evenings in the old church to help adults keep their children in school, develop good study habits, apply to college, interpret record cards, etc. (223:23/09/1990) (223:30/09/1990) (223:07/10/1990) (223:14/10/1990).

An After School Tutoring program began in the school on September 25, 1990 in the school (223:23/09/1990). Tutors were available on Tuesday and Thursday evenings (223:14/10/1990). Beginning in June 1991, the San José Youth Organization agreed to cosponsor the tutoring program with the S.U.A.V.E. group. Children had to register and pay a $15 fee per family for insurance but financial aid was available (223:09/06/1991). The money came from a Thanksgiving Dinner in November that was to benefit the tutoring program (223).

S.U.A.V.E. planned a summer tutoring program for 11th graders and younger from June 4 to August 4, 1991, four hours a day (223:12/05/1991). Ramiro Reyes, an AISD teacher, was the coordinator (223:05/19/1991). The after school tutoring for all grades began again on September 10 from 4PM-6PM in the school building. Tutoring was offered on Tuesday and Thursday (223:08/09/1991). In February 1992, Rocio Balderas was seeking college students to help with the program (223:09/02/1992).

The tutoring program was linked with an English as a Second Language (ESL) program. In January 1992, it was announced that the after school Tutoring and Learn to Speak English Classes would resume on Tuesday and Thursday (223:05/01/1992). All classes were suspended for two weeks for Easter and then resumed (223:29/03/1992) until May 24 and then suspended for the summer (223:24/05/1992).

The tutoring program started again at the end of September 1992 (223:27/09/1992) and continued until it was suspended for Christmas on December 13. Greg Berry, Director of Religious Education, was the coordinator of the tutoring and ESL programs (223:20/12/1992). The last day for tutoring was on May 12, 1993. Pat Rodriguez, who was in charge the tutoring program, asked for donations of computers, typewriters, printers, books, calculators, games, text books and workbooks and volunteers for the next year. (223:09/05/1993). Among the tutors were Ramiro Reyes, Hunter Aldridge, Carlo Botello, Peter Valenzuela and Mary Jane Rangel (223:09/05/1993).

Planning began for continuing the tutoring program in June (223:06/06/1993). The Texas Education Agency donated reading books to the program (223:27/06/1993). Orientation for the tutors took place on September 1 and tutoring began on September 8 on Monday and Wednesday evenings (223:29/08/1993).

### World Youth Day

In July 1985, forty-one teenagers and adults from San José Parish left on the church bus for the 10th Annual Youth Conference in Steubenville, Ohio (223: 21/07/1985). They repeated in trip in 1986 and 1987. In 1985, Pope John Paul II initiated an event for young people called World Youth Day. The event took place on the Diocesan level each year beginning in 1986 and was celebrated at the international level every two or three years in different locations.

The Diocese of Austin sponsored World Youth Day in Rockdale, Texas in October 1989. All middle and high school students were invited to what was an all-day event. The church bus made the trip in 1989 (223:22/10/1989). In 1990, St. Michael’s Academy sponsored a World Youth Day program on October 20 from 10Am to 10PM including a dance (223:23/09/1990) but there is no indication that anyone from San José Parish attended

In 1993 World Youth Day was celebrated in Denver, Colorado. San José planned to send a group of parishioners (aged 13-39) to Colorado for the International Gathering of Young Adults and Youth on August 11-15. In January people who were interested in going to Denver, Colorado to see the Pope were urged to apply by February 15 at the church office. The contact in the office was Glendora De Leon (223:31/01/1993).

The pastor specified that fund raising for this trip had to take place away from the parish, “since all fund raising here goes for our youth programs (e.g. CCD, Tutoring, Karate, etc.). Any other fundraising must go for charity to help our people in crisis financial situations”. For this reason, the decision was made to raise fund for the trip to Denver by washing cars. The money would go toward the youth who worked at these car washes (223:14/02/1993). Perhaps, as an exception to this decision, the youth of the parish who wanted to go to Denver to see the Pope prepared and served breakfast on April 11, 1993 after 8:00, 9:30 and 11:00 Masses (223:11/04/1993).

## Catholic War Veterans, San José Post 1805

The Catholic War Veterans is a national service organization of baptized Catholics who served in the Armed Forces of the United States. It was founded in 1935. The programs of the national organization include promoting Americanism, Catholic Action, Veterans’ Welfare, youth activities and documenting the history of the organization.

The website of the San Jose Catholic War Veterans Post 1805 states their primary objective, “is to make the entire nation acute aware of the struggle and needs of many veterans, their widows and children” (Catholic War Veterans, texvet.org).

The first Post of the Catholic War Veterans in Austin was founded at St. Mary’s Church (now Cathedral) in 1948 but it only lasted for one year (265). In 1953, Post 742 of the Catholic War Veterans existed at Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in Austin (265).

### Formed in 1956

Post 1805 of the Catholic War Veterans was organized at the second San José church in 1956. Pete Castillo, Lee Castillo, Gabriel Tamillo and Joe Uriegas were some of 18 charter members (193) (265). Rev. Houser and Rev. Father John Haley served as Post Chaplains. Sometime later retired US Army Col. Joseph Kmiecik became the chaplain. Rev. Kmiecik, C.S.C. retired after 30 years of service as a military chaplain and was assigned to St. Ignatius. He was an acquaintance of Joe Uriegas of the San José CWV and served as the chaplain of the Post in the 1990s until he left Austin (265).

After Post 1805 was organized, Manuel Castillo and other men from CWV Post 742 at Guadalupe church moved to San Jose Post 1805 when someone stole the group’s money and Post 742 dissolved (193). The San Jose Post quickly became an important and active part of the San José Parish community (211).

In 1960, the Catholic War Veterans received Communion as a group on the 2nd Sunday of the month (223:12/04/60). The CWV Post had regular meetings on Wednesdays (223:03/11/62) and occasionally hosted regional meetings at San José (223:10/14/62). The CWV Post at San José Parish focused on three areas: helping with all the dances at San José, helping with sports for young people (Sam Guerra and Romero Sanchez were coaches) and helping the Boy Scouts (Enrique Saenz was the Scout Master) (58) (223:08/18/63).

### CWV helped the parish

The San José Post also helped the church in other ways. They served breakfast (223:01/29/61) and helped at other events. In April 1962, the Veterans were in charge of parking and order for the Diocesan Spanish Convention. They wore their special Veteran’s Caps and guarded the cars during the Procession, Mass and Jamaica from 1PM until after the 5PM Mass (223:04/01/62). In addition to providing security, los Veteranos Católicos sponsored a “carro alegorico” for the Spanish Convention that year (6).  

In June 1962, Fr. Houser asked the Socios and the Veterans to handle the San José dance on July 28 (223:06/03/62). The dance was in the Coliseum with Alfonso Ramos Orchestra. “We want all of our dances to be truly Christian recreation”, he said (meaning no drunkenness was allowed) (223:07/22/62). The Pastor was pleased at the outcome of the dance and asked the same two groups to take charge of the San José Dance on August 25th (223:08/05/62).

In December 1963, the Veterans sponsored a Mass at 10:00AM for the late President John Kennedy (who was a CWV member) and the CWV founder Monsignor Edward J. Higgins. After Mass, they served breakfast in the Hall. They placed an Honor Guard in the church during the Mass (223:12/01/63).

The Veterans, like many other San Jose parish organizations, helped pay down the parish debt. In November 1961, the Veterans gave $41 towards the parish debt. The pastor was able to announce that, “In the past 12 months, we have paid $14,000 on our debt which is now $60,000” (223:11/19/61). During 1963, the Veterans donated $323 to the church (223:03/08/64) and in January they made a donation of $38 for the church’s debt (223:01/19/64). They took a collection at their monthly meetings and donated the money to the church. In August, they donated $40 to the church (223:08/02/64) and in September $45 (223:09/13/64). Their meetings were on Tuesday at 8:00PM (223:03/22/64) (223:05/31/64).

### The Ladies Auxiliary

The Ladies Auxiliary of San Jose Post 1805 of the Catholic War Veterans was formed in November 1964 with Rev. Samuel J. Ciatto, C.S.C., as their Chaplain (53). In 1993, Rev. John Korcsmar, C.S.C., was the Chaplain. The Ladies Auxiliary of the Catholic War Veterans San Jose Post met separately from the Veterans and had their own officers. They met on the 2nd Monday of each month and had their corporate Communion on the 1st Sunday of the month at 10:00AM Mass.

The installation of officers of the first officers of the Ladies Auxiliary took place in February 1965 (223:02/14/65). In July 1965, Theresa Casarez was the President of Ladies Auxiliary and Gabriel Tamayo was the Post Commander (53).

The Ladies Auxiliary held a barbecue fundraiser on the grounds of San Jose Church from 10:00AM to 2:00PM on a Sunday in February 1965 (223:02/28/65) and the Veterans continued to donate small sums of money to the Parish building fund. In August 1965, the Veterans donated $65 (223:08/15/65) and in October $23 (223:10/03/65). The Catholic War Veterans also helped with the ground breaking of the San José School on October 24, 1965 (37).

In 1966, the Ladies Auxiliary had a cake sale on January 23 and February 20 (223:01/23/66) and raised enough money to donate four library tables to the new school that were valued at $119.80 (223:04/24/66). The Veterans were able to donate an additional $75 in July (223:07/10/66) (223:05/15/66) and the Ladies Auxiliary donated $119 to the school for desks in September (223:09/25/66). In November 1966, the CWV Ladies Auxiliary sold cakes while the men supervised parking at the blessing of the new school (223:10/16/66).                       

The corporate communion for the Ladies Auxiliary was the first or second Sunday at the 10:00AM Mass. The Veterans and the Ladies Auxiliary took mass together once every three months (223:01/31/71). On those occasions, the Ladies and their husbands processed into the sanctuary accompanied by an honor guard carrying flags instead of the banners carried by other sodalities (223:03/17/68). The day and time of the corporate mass varied based upon a consensus decision of the members but the corporate mass was usually at 10AM (Pete Castillo).

During the late 1960s, the Veterans and the Ladies Auxiliary sponsored a “Mexican Breakfast” in the Community Center in December 1967 (223:12/03/67), a dance at the City Coliseum in October 1967 (223:10/08/67) and helped at the church bazaar in May 1968 (223:04/07/68). In June 1968, the pastor, Father John Haley, told a reporter that that San Jose Catholic War Veterans was among the seventh largest organizations at San Jose Church (122).

### The Home Post was on S. Congress Avenue

On February 2, 1969, Gabriel Tamayo, Raymond Rodriguez and Sam Guerra of the Catholic War Veterans approached the San Jose Parish Council and asked to purchase the church’s part of a lot on S. 5th Street. Their intention was to build a clubhouse for the Post. The Veterans already owned one half of the property. The Parish Council agreed to sell the lot for $1,293.50 (213). Gabriel Gutierrez, a lawyer who had grown up in the parish and was a member of the CWV, handled the paperwork for the sale of the church lot. The church received $1,628.74 from the sale (213). The Post eventually decided not to build on the lot and sold it for $2,000 (193). The first Commander of Post 1805 worked for a man who owned a motor repair shop in South Austin. The Post Commander leased a house at 4913 S. South Congress Avenue from his boss and he subleased the building to the CWV Post for use as their headquarters (193). The Post occupied the building from about 1987 until 2017. In 2017, the owner sold the property to a developer and Post 1085 had to vacate the premises. They sold the equipment that they had installed in the building and moved their meeting place to St. Paul’s Catholic Church.

During 1969 and 1970, the Ladies Auxiliary met in the library of the school at San Jose at 7:30PM on the first Monday of each month (223:07/06/69) (223:08/03/69) (223:11/02/69) (233:03/01/70) (223:05/31/70). In September, they met to elect officers for the coming year (223:09/07/69). The Ladies Auxiliary sponsored a White Elephant booth at the May 4 church bazaar in 1969 (223:04/27/69) and sold cakes on at least three occasions in 1970 (223:01/18/70) (223:10/11/70) (223:10/18/70). They continued to attend mass as a group once a month and jointly with the Veterans every three months (223:08/31/69) (223:11/22/70) (223:01/31/71) (223:05/30/71) (223:30/07/72) (249: 31/03/74).

In October 1969, the CWV Commander, Roger Ibarra, told the Parish Council that the Post would sponsor Boy Scout Troop 94 (213). The Post also agreed to pay half of the cost of new uniforms for the Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts continued to work folding the Herald and La Fuerza newspapers to pay their share (213).

In 1971, the Ladies Auxiliary gathered names of deceased mothers and placed them on the altar on Mother’s Day (223:05/09/71) and, in 1972, they operated three booths at the annual bazaar in May and earned $295 (223:21/05/72).

### State Officers

During the last half of the 1970s, the San Jose Post took a leadership role in the Catholic War Veterans state organization. In October 1974, Neff L. Zendejas was elected Post Commander (250:12/09/74). He was employed as the Assistant Veterans Service Officer for Travis County and had extensive contacts among Texas veterans’ organizations. In December, the American G.I. Forum Veterans Outreach Program announced their services in the San Jose bulletin (250: 01/12/74). The G.I. Forum was a Hispanic veterans and civil rights organization. Its headquarters was in San Antonio and it had a strong presence in Austin (223:23/03/75).

The Post began to collect newspapers and magazines to sell as paper to raise money for scholarships (250: 20/10/74) and the Veterans and the Ladies Auxiliary continued to work with the parish. In 1975 and 1976, they sponsored five dances in the San Jose Community Center (223:12/01/75) (223:13/04/75) (223:11/01/76) (223:16/05/76). The proceeds from the dances were donated to the church bazaar committee or to the scholarship fund. The Ladies sold food at the annual church bazaars (223:02/05/76) and at their meeting hall (called the Home Post) on S. Congress Avenue (223:29/06/75). They continued to take Holy Communion together every two or three months (223:24/08/75). In February 1976, the Ladies Auxiliary was in charge of cleaning the church (223:08/02/76). The Sunday Bulletin urged parishioners to donate rags or paper towels to use in cleaning the church (223:15/02/76).

In June 1975, four members of San Jose Post 1805 were named outstanding members at the 30th annual state CWV convention (102) and in June 1976 six men from San Jose Post 1805 and five women from San Jose Post 1805 Ladies Auxiliary were elected to state officer positions (104). The San Jose post also won three awards (223:27/06/76). The State Officers Board Meeting in July 1976 was held at San Jose with sixty CWV members from South Texas attending the meeting (223:11/07/76). During this time, the Commander was N. L. Zendejas and the President of the Ladies Auxiliary was Amparo Longori (237).

The San Jose Post hosted the CWV state quarterly meeting in October 1981. The delegates attended Mass on 7:00PM Saturday at San Jose (223: 25/10/1981). In January 1986, the CWV Department of Texas held its meeting in Austin and the veterans and the ladies of the auxiliary attended Mass together at 12:30PM (223:22/04/84) (223:19/01/1986)

The Ladies Auxiliary continued to meet on Mondays at 7:30PM (223:04/02/79) and their corporate mass was on the 4th Sunday at 10AM (223: 29/0882). In 1982, the Ladies Auxiliary managed the Wednesday evening Bingo in the Community Center (223:08/08/82) (223:30/01/83). The majority of the profits are given to college students for textbooks and living expenses (265).

The Ladies Auxiliary sponsored an annual dance in the Community Center in January or February (223:30/01/83). In January 1985, it was their 20th Anniversary Dance (223:13/01/1985). The ladies helped with Mother’s Day Cards and First Communion Mass (223:08/05/83) and with Father’s Day Cards (223: 23/06/1985). They provided refreshments for the San Jose Confirmation Ceremony reception in 1985 (223:28/04/1985).

Two graduating seniors, Anita Cantu and Gerri Gonzales, received scholarships from the Ladies Auxiliary and CWV Post 1805 in June 1985. Post 1805 also partnered the Father Joe Znotas Scholarship Fund to provide scholarships to two other students (Audrey Ortiz and Ana Maria Saldana). The pastor said San Jose parishioners enabled the parish to contribute $1,000 to the Fr. Joe Znotas Scholarship Fund in 1985 (223: 02/06/1985).

In 1986, the Ladies Auxiliary donated $100.00 to the San José Building Fund (223; 16/03/1986). The Ladies Auxiliary furnished and served refreshments for the Confirmation ceremony in April 1986 (223: 27/04/1986) and Post 1805 sponsored a mass at Assumption Cemetery Chapel on Monday, May 26 in honor of deceased veterans (223: 18/05/1986). The memorial mass became an annual event and in 1991, Catholic War Veterans, Post 1805, invited parishioners to a Mass Wreath Placing and flag lowering ceremony at Assumption Cemetery on Monday, May 27 (223:05/26/1991). P.O.W.s and M.I.A.s were remembered at a memorial Mass at San Jose on June 30 (223:16/06/1991).

For about a year, the Catholic War Veterans ran an ad in the San José Church Sunday Bulletin from April 27, 1986 to July 12, 1987. The advertisement was for their bingo games on Monday and Thursday evenings at the Home Post at 4913 S. Congress. They also offered the building as a hall rental (223:12/07/1987). The Veterans installed a kitchen in the building and were able to prepare and serve food there. It was used for their own meetings, for dances and bingo and was available to community organizations as a meeting place. The Veterans and the Ladies Auxiliary continued to work with San Jose parish. In 1991, the CWV and Ladies Auxiliary donated $400 and $100 as prizes for the Jamaica raffle (223:20/10/1991) and, in October 1992, the Guadalupanas and Catholic War Veterans Post 1805 served breakfast at the San José Community Center (223:01/11/1992). The 35th Anniversary Dance was in the parish hall with Alfonso Ramos y Su Orchestra. Tickets were sold after Mass and in the church office (223:22/11/1992).

Joe Uriegas and other members of the Post were involved in Democratic Party politics, particularly the South Austin Tejano Democrats (265) and had some influence with the Democratic Party. In February 2007, the US Post Office at 3903 South Congress was renamed after Sergeant Henry Ybarra III who was killed in Iraq on September 11, 2003. He was a member of San Jose Catholic Church. His father was a Vietnam War Veteran and a member of CWV Post 1085. US Representative Lloyd Doggett sponsored H. R. 577 at the urging of the Catholic War Veterans, Tejanos in Action and the Knights of Columbus (Congressional Record-House, Vol. 153, Pt. 3, February 5, 2007).

In 2017, the Commander was Julian A. Mendoza. The Catholic War Veterans met on the second Tuesday of each month and the Ladies Auxiliary met on the first Tuesday of each month. According to its web page, the primary objective of the Post was to make the entire nation aware of the struggle and needs of veterans, their widows and their children (265). In the summer of 2017, the building on South Congress that housed the Post HQ was sold and the Post had to vacate the building. The contents of the kitchen were sold to a man in New Mexico and the Post moved its meeting place to St. Paul’s Church on a temporary basis (Pete Castillo).

## Cursillos de Cristiandad

Cursillos in Christianity/Cursillos de Cristiandad is an apostolic movement of the Roman Catholic Church. It was founded in Majorca, Spain, by a group of laymen in 1944 while they were refining a technique to train pilgrimage leaders.

The Cursillo focuses on training Catholic laypeople to be leaders in their community. The training takes place over a three-day weekend and consists of fifteen sessions led by priests and laypeople. The Cursillistas return to their parishes for “the fourth day” of the Cursillo during which they meet weekly. Parish groups are called Ultreyas or friendship groups (12). A traditional Spanish folk song, “De Colores”, became the anthem of the Cursillo and a multi-colored rooster its symbol (National Cursillo).

The first Cursillo in the Americas was held in Waco, Texas, in 1957 and the national Cursillo office is currently located in Jarrell, Texas. The new spiritual exercise appeared in the Austin Diocese in 1961. Cursillos were held first in Waco and then at St. William’s Church in Round Rock.

### An Ultreya formed in 1961

The first Ultreya in Austin met at Guadalupe Church in January 12, 1961 (223:01/08/61). The pastor of San José said that, “We hope that other men will join this splendid movement…” (223:01/22/61). By the end of February 1961, enough parishioners from San José had attended a Cursillo that an Ultreya began meeting at San José Parish on Wednesday nights. The Sunday Bulletin announced that the next Cursillo was scheduled for March 2nd in Waco (223:02/26/61). The Cursillos were segregated by the sex of the participants and Cursillos for men and women took place on different weekends on a rotating basis (223:05/21/61).

The Cursillistas returned from Waco energized and organized. In March 1961, the  
Cursillistos assumed the charge of the all-night vigil on Holy Thursday from 7:00PM until 8:00AM (223:03/26/61). The next year, they shared responsibility for the all-night Holy Thursday Adoration with the Socios. The participants spent the night from 9:00PM to 7:00AM in prayer (223:04/15/62). The Cursillistas were in charge of adoration on Holy Thursday until at least 1966 (223:03/22/64) (223:04/03/66).

In April 1962, when Rosendo Galinda was in charge of the San José Ultreya, the Cursillistas from San José sponsored a “carro alegorico” (a float) at the Diocesan Spanish Convencion (6). The floats carried images of saints (that were borrowed from a church) and depicted a scene in the life of the saint (223:02/04/62). The Spanish Convention was at San José Parish in 1962 (223:10/01/61).

### Cursillistas worked as Cathechists

In July 1962, the Cursillistas of San José sponsored a Jamaica with bingo games to raise money to send people to the Cursillos in Round Rock (223:07/01/62) (223:07/22/62). A Cursillo for either men or women was announced in the Sunday Bulletin about every two months in 1963 and 1964 (223:09/22/63) (223:11/03/63) (223:12/29/63) (223:04/05/64) (223:05/17/64) (223:06/07/64) (223:06/14/64). The pastor was an enthusiastic supporter and explained that, “A Cursillo is a brief course in theology. What a priest studies during his life, you study for three days” (223:01/12/64). Another time, he said, “A cursillo is a short course in Christianity lasting from Thursday to Sunday. There are five meditations and five conferences given by priests and ten given by men called professors. A cursillo is made only once, followed by retreats” (223:01/31/65).

In September 1962, the Cursillistas agree to work in the San José religious education program as CCD teachers, fishers (home visitors) and drivers (223:09/16/62). The pastor, Fr. Houser, was so impressed by their work that he urged the Cursillistas to take over and run the CCD program the next year (223:01/20/63) (223:02/10/63) (223:02/03/63).

Beginning in May 1963, the Ultreya met on Tuesday at 7:30PM instead of on Wednesday nights (223:05/26/63) (223:01/05/64) but, a year later, returned to meeting on Wednesdays (223:04/05/64) (223:11/08/64). Between 1968 and 1981, the Ultreya met on Thursday nights after Mass (223:12/31/67) (223:02/11/68). In 1981 the meeting day was changed to Monday (223:20/09/1981). The Ultreya was necessary to keep alive the spirit of the Cursillo (223:10/17/65) and an Ultreya met at San José once a month, every two weeks or weekly for the next forty years.

In 1967, before breakfasts were served in the Community Center after Sunday Mass on a weekly basis, the Cursillistas served menudo after each Mass on November 12 as a fund raiser (223:11/12/67). In June 1968, they hosted a dinner and dance in the parish hall (223:06/16/68) and in December 1965, individuals from the CYO and Cursillistas worked many hours decorating the Church (223:12/26/65). However, the focus of the Ultreya was always their religious practices. In 1968, they were reminded that, “the cursillo never ends, there is always the fourth day” (223:10/20/68) and that, “the fourth day is the most important of all” (223:12/15/68).

In March 1969, the Cursillistas of San José sponsored a planning meeting to prepare for Holy Week throughout the City of Austin (223:03/30/69). The Cursillistas of the Diocese hoped to hold their Fiesta de Colores on September 6 in the new San José Community Center (223:07/13/69). Cursillos were held at St. Williams Church in Round Rock (223:07/20/69) but the Fiesta of Colores was held in different locations. The event was moved to September 7 from 10:00AM to 10:00PM at the Municipal Auditorium (223:08/31/69) because the opening of the San José Community Center was delayed until October (223:10/05/69).

Miss Joanie Herrera was a candidate for Queen at the Fiesta de Colores that took place on September 7, 1969. She sponsored a cake sale after each Mass on August 3 to raise funds for her campaign (223:08/03/69). On August 31, she and the San José Ultreya sponsored a barbecue after the three morning Masses (223:08/31/69). She won the Queen contest on the basis of the amount of money she raised (223:09/07/69).

In 1970, the San José Cursillistas nominated Sylvia Samaniego as their Queen candidate for the cursillistas’ convention (223:05/17/70). In May, they sold barbecue from 11:00AM until 3:00PM to support their candidate (223:05/17/70). That year, the Fiesta de Colores met on June 14 from 10:00AM to 10:00PM at VFW Post 8787 in North Austin (223:06/14/70). The following year, the 1971 Fiesta de Colores was at San José on June 13 (223:05/09/71). This was an all-day event (223:06/06/71). San José sponsored Gloria Buentello as their candidate for sweetheart. In May, the Cursillistas sponsored a barbecue dinner after Mass to raise money for their sweetheart candidate (223:05/30/71).

### Cursillistas were Song Leaders

Music plays a central role in the Cursillo weekend and Cursillistas have their own song list. The Cursillistas led hymn singing at the 10:00AM Sunday Mass (223:02/16/64) even before the Church began to encourage congregational singing in December 1964 (223:11/01/64). In 1970, they invited all parishioners to Spanish language singing practice after their 7:00PM meetings on Thursday nights (223:01/04/70). In May 1972, the Cursillistas sponsored one booth at the annual church bazaar and earned $30 for the church (223:21/05/72).

In addition to their work at San José, all male cursillistas were encouraged to attend a clausura at Round Rock on a Sunday in October 1971 (223:10/10/71). A second clausura for women took place in November. Cursillos and retreats were announced in the Sunday Bulletin and in notices posted at the entrance of the church (223:09/05/70). In November 1971, San José Cursillistas were invited to an apostolic hour following the 7:00PM Thursday Mass to plan for future events at San José (223:14/11/71). That year the convention took place in February in Round Rock (223:06/02/72).

In 1981, the Ultreya met in the evening on the first Monday of each month at 7:00PM (223:07/06/1981) (223:20/09/1981) (223:20/06/82). Beginning in October 1983, the San José Ultreya met each Monday instead of once a month (223:27/01/1985) (223;16/03/1986). In 1983, the contacts for the San José Ultreya were Tom and Mary Longoria (223:06/02/83).

Rev. Underwood was a strong supporter of the Cursillo and, in 1984, he identified the key movements in the Catholic church as marriage encounter, R.C.I.A., Cursillo, Parish Renewal and the Charismatic Movement (223:04/11/84). From August 1983 until March 1986, the Cursillistas and the Rosary Crusade along with five other parish organizations led the prayers for one hour each during the First Friday Adoration service (223:28/08/83). The service lasted from 7:45PM until midnight with each sodality leading the prayers for one hour on a rotating schedule. The Cursillistas continued in this service until the pastor changed and shortened the program in 1986 (223:30/03/1986). Even after this change, the Cursillistas continue to faithfully attend First Friday services.

### Cursillistas raised money for the new church

San José Cursillistas took a leadership role in the Austin Ultreya (223:02/10/83) and the Fiesta De Colores in Round Rock (223:24/06/84). In 1986, Mrs. Stella Trejo, Coordinator of the Cursillo Movement in Austin and a San José parishioner, was appointed to the U.S. Bishop’s National Advisory Council for a four-year term (223: 20/07/1986). In 1986, San José Cursillistas sponsored Lydia Acuña, aged 11, as the Cursillo Queen Candidate. A band called Los Comandos de Hector and Aurelio Rodriguez y Grupo Reforma played for a benefit dance for Queen Candidate Lydia Acuña at the San José Community Center in July. Lydia Acuna, the daughter of Daniel Acuña, was 3rd runner-up as Austin Candidate for the Fiesta de Colores. She raised $2,304.91 (223: 03/08/1986). The proceeds from the queen contest were for the Cursillo Building Fund (223: 13/07/1986).

In October 1986, the Cursillistas sponsored a benefit dance for the new church with music by Los Viajeros Del Norte. Tickets were $4 per sale and $6 at the door (223: 05/10/1968). The dance raised $917.35 for the church building fund (223:09/11/1986). In December 1987, the 8:00AM Choir and the Cursillistas had a joint garage sale and tamale sale in the Parish Hall (223: 29/11/1987). They raised $1,144.85 for the church at another benefit dance in July 1988 (223:21/08/1988).

In February 1990, San José hosted an Ultreya InterParroquial from 7:00PM to 9:00PM for Cursillistas who had already completed the three-day Cursillo. The announcement was in Spanish only (223:04/02/1990).

In June 1992 and 1993, a Fiesta De Colores was held at the Cursillo Center in Jarrell. The highlight of the celebration was the coronation of the Fiesta De Colores Queen. A fiesta with music and entertainment followed the coronation (223:28/06/1992). In 1993, the San José bus was used to make the trip to the Fiesta De Colores (223:20/06/1993). In November 1993, the Franciscan preaching team that was working in San José Parish held a Gran Encuentro Con Jesus at Centro de Cursillos in Jarrel with Brothers Edgar Palacios and Jesse Martinez, Father Raul Rogawski, Sister Helena Raycraft and Deacon Concho Castillo. The announcement was in Spanish only (223:14/11/1993).

With only the occasional break, an Ultreya continued to meet every week in San José Parish following the Monday 7:00PM Mass from 1988 until 2018 except when another Cursillo event conflicted with the meeting time or the church was closed (223). The Ultreya at Cristo Rey Church met every second Saturday of the month (223:26/12/1993) and was attended by some San José parishioners.

## Hijas de María

A pious organization of young unmarried women called Hijas de María appeared at San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio around 1890. Like the other sodalities at the Cathedral, the group had a code of conduct for its members, urged its members to practice specific devotions and take communion together, probably once a month. Like other sodalities, the Hijas de María had a banner that they carried in processions and displayed at meetings. At public events, such as processions, and at their meetings and events, the women dressed in white. The Hijas de María promoted Marian devotions, in particular those honoring the Patron of Mexico, the Virgin de Guadalupe. They were very active in organizing events such as plays, concerts, parties and dinners and were one of the largest of the 18 pious societies at San Fernando church in 1930 (269).

In 1940, Guadalupe Church in Austin had a similar organization for unmarried women of the same name (3). A group was organized at San José Mexican Mission prior to April 1940 (5) and, in December 1940, had fifteen members (1). In December 1940, the other sodalities or pious associations at San José were the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús that enrolled 26 members, the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de María that enrolled 24 members and Young Catholic Men (Juventud Catolica) that enrolled 20 members (1) (Photo066). The membership of each of the four associations was persons of a particular age and gender. The Hijas de María were unmarried women, the Juventud Catolica were unmarried men, the Socias were married women and the Socios were married men.   

The four associations worked together for the benefit of the church. The second recorded Jamaica of San José Parish was held on the church grounds on May 4, 1941. The program included a sit-down dinner. The ladies of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Mary were in charge of the kitchen and young women of the Hijas de María were the servers. The young men of the Juventud Catolica were in charge of the drinks (Photo066).

The Hijas of María sent delegates to the annual Diocesan Spanish Convention. At the Spanish Conventions, each society was allowed one hour for discussion and was encouraged to bring up any subject of interest to the Society or the Church. The delegates of the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús, the men’s society, were the first to meet. Next the delegates of the Sociedad de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe met. Finally the delegates from the Hijas de María, the young women’s society, met. No priest attended these meetings, to allow for freedom of discussion. Finally, all sodalities met in common, with the priests present, and summaries of the three meetings were given. The reports were followed by discussion. Then the Jamaica continued on until dark (5).

Betwen 1951 and 1953, the Assistant Pastor, Rev. John Driscoll, C.S.C., was the group’s spiritual adviser. Beginning in 1954, the Hijas de María helped raise funds for parish’s second church (221). During the late 1950s, the group stopped meeting. In December 1960, Rev. Houser attempted to revive the group (223:12/25/60) and they began meeting monthly at 11:00AM on Sunday, probably immediately after religious education (Doctrina) classes (223:01/15/61) (223:02/19/61).

In February 1961, Fr. Houser placed the Hijas de María in charge of the May Devotions. In Catholic theology, the month of May is associated with the Virgin Mary and, in San Antonio the Hijas de María organized many of events during May in honor of the Virgin Mary. At San José church in 1961, the devotions were celebrated from Sunday, May 14 until Friday, May 19. The girls dressed in white clothing and brought flowers to present to the image of the Virgin (223:05/07/61). In March, they marched on the Feast of San José in a procession of the sodalities, Veterans, Scouts, Servers and children representing the Holy Family. All the church organizations celebrated Communion together on that day (223:03/19/61).

Sometime between 1961 and 1975, the Hijas de María as an organization disappeared from San José parish. Several parishes, including Our Lady of Guadalupe in Austin, continued to send delegates from the Hijas de María to the annual Spanish Convention until as late as 1988 (7) (13). Gradually, the Hijas de María were replaced by groups such as the Sociedad Guadalupana de Jovenes in some churches (194) and disappeared altogether in others.

At San José, the Catholic Youth Organization replaced the traditional pious organizations for young women (Hijas de Maria) and young men (Juventud Católica). The first Catholic Youth Organization was formed as an athletic association to keep young men from engaging in criminal activities (CYO website). The organization was brought to the Diocese of Austin in 1957 (DCYC website) and to San José parish in the 1960s (193).

According to Fr. Houser, “The CYO is not a social club although they have social fiestas. It is more like a sodality whose main purpose is religion or the spiritual life. In the CYO, the youth learn obedience to God and parents” (223:12/23/62). Nevertheless, the pastor struggled to get CYO members to assist at Mass as altar boys and to receive Holy Communion (223:01/22/67).                                         

The CYO was materially different from the traditional pious associations it replaced. The San José Catholic Youth Organization was formed for the purpose of providing wholesome and healthful recreational activities for the physical and spiritual well being of the youth. Membership is open to all high school students and young adults, whether male or female. The leadership was often in the hands of young women.

A priest moderator and volunteer sponsors offered direction and guidance at the weekly meetings but the youth were totally responsible for carrying out their duties and responsibilities (209). While the CYO was not a traditional sodality, it was an effective fundraiser and did manage to keep the youth of the parish engaged and out of trouble, at least at San José.

## Joventud Católica

Three sodalities (pious societies) were organized at San José Church in the spring of 1940. The societies were organized by age and sex of the participants. The two adult sodalities were la Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús and Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de María. The sodality for young women was called Hijas de María. Sometime later, a sodality for young men, Joventud Católica, was formed (3) (5).

In December 1940, the four sodalities enrolled 85 members out of a total of 320 parishioners from 65 families. The San José Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús enrolled 26 members, Sagrado Corazón de María enrolled 24 Socias, Hijas de María enrolled 15 young women and Juventud Catolica enrolled 20 young men (1).

In 1940, there was a Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús, a Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de María and an organization of Hijas de María at Guadalupe Church in Austin (3). All of the original parishioners of San Jose parish had previously attended Guadalupe Church so it was relatively easy to establish these organizations at San Jose. There was apparently no group of Juventud Católica at Guadalupe Church and it was founded at San José at a later date than the other three sodalities.

La Asociacion Catolica de la Joventud Mexicana (ACJM) was founded in Mexico in 1913. By 1923, most Mexican parishes had branches of Joventud Católica. The stated purpose of the organization was to restore Christian social order that had been disrupted by the Mexican Revolution. Joventud Católica worked closely with the parish priest and the local bishop and most “acejotaemeros” (members of Joventud Católica) were partisans in the Cristera War. In 1929, the ACJM became part of la Accion Católica Mexicana (Wikipedia, Asociacion Catolica de la Joventud Mexicana) (Milenio Diario, S.A. De C.V., April 10, 2015).

During and after the Cristera War, many Cristeros (as many as 5% of the Mexican population) fled to the United States, particularly to Los Angeles, California and San Antonio, Texas. Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans immigrated to Texas. Some of the expelled bishops and many Catholic priests were among the exiles (Knights of Columbus online, 4/26/2012). The large number of exiled priests in San Antonio was particularly active in supporting the Cristiada in Mexico. It was probably in this period that the Juventud Católica was organized in Texas although the details are unknown.

For whatever reason, Juventud Católica quickly disappeared from San José parish and after 1941 there was no further mention of the group in the archives of San José Parish.  

## Knights of Columbus Council #10148

The Knights of Columbus is the world’s largest Catholic fraternal service organization. KOC was originally a mutual benefit society that evolved into an insurance company. The Knights of Columbus (KC) is a tax-exempt fraternal insurance company that sells financial products to its members who live in the USA and Canada. The Order was founded in 1882 in Connecticut and reached Texas in 1902. In 1904 a Texas state council was created. KOC Councils are parish-based. Today there are about eighty Knights of Columbus Councils in the Diocese of Austin.

In the early 1960s, a headquarters building for the KOC State Council was built on land donated by Charles Dellana in what is now Zilker Park (223:10/06/63). In the 1960s, San José CYO and other organizations used the KOC Hall on at 2500 Columbus Drive for dances (223:04/07/68). The KOC Hall in Zilker Park is small and, in December 1969, the Knights of Columbus rented the San José Community Center for a New Year’s Eve dance (223:12/28/69). The capacity of the San José Community Center was 450 persons (223:18/02/1990).

In May 1984, the Sunday Bulletin announced that representatives from the Knights of Columbus would be at San José after all Masses to talk to men interested in joining the Knights (223:06/05/84). Five years later, the Sunday Bulletin again announced that someone from KOC would be in the Hall, and later in the school, after Mass to answer questions (223:07/05/89). Lucas Barron, a field agent for Knights of Columbus Insurance, was seeking men to become charter members of San José KOC (223:28/05/89).

In June and July 1989, men filled out cards to become founding members of a Knights of Columbus Council at San José Parish. They were invited to an open house in the parish hall on June 13, 7:30PM (223:11/06/1989). By July, 19 men had joined the San José Council. Their first business meeting was Monday July 31 at 7:30PM (223:30/07/1989). An orientation meeting for candidates was held in the parish hall on September 6 (223:03/09/1989).

### Council #10148 was chartered in 1989

On September 12, 1989, San José Council #10148 Knights of Columbus was chartered with 44 charter members. The first Grand Knight was Victor Balderas (223:01/10/1989).

## Legion of Mary

The Legion of Mary is a society of lay Catholics founded in Dublin, Ireland in 1921. Its object is to glorify God through the holiness of its members developed by prayer and service. The Legionaries’ service involves spiritual works of mercy rather than corporal or material service. The Legionaries commit to pray daily according to their type of membership. In addition, active members meet weekly for a devotional service.

The Sunday Bulletin of June 6, 1965 mentioned a Junior Legion of Mary. The pastor said that, “The Junior Legion of Mary may have the first Sunday of the month as their Communion Sunday at the 8:00AM Mass (223:06/06/65). They meet on Thursday night 7-8PM” (223:10/17/65). The membership of the Junior Legion of Mary was restricted to persons under 18 years of age. The presence of a Junior Legion meant that a Senior Legion of Mary for adults also existed at San Jose but the Sunday Bulletin makes no mention of another Legion of Mary in the parish.

In 1993, the Legion of Mary celebrated their 40th Anniversary at St. Mary’s Cathedral (223:03/10/1993). This must refer to when the Legion was first introduced into the Diocese of Austin. The Legion crossed to the United States in 1931 and must have arrived in Austin in 1953.

Even though the Legion disappeared from the parish sometime after 1965, it soon reappeared. According to the November 7, 1993 issue of the Sunday Bulletin, the San José Legion of Mary began to meet in the Sacred Heart Chapel on Sunday, November 7. Margaret Martinez was the contact person (223:07/11/1993). The Bulletin explained that, “the Legion of Mary is a worldwide organization of Catholics who offer their services to Mary to placing themselves under her banner in performing spiritual works in their community. Examples of apostolic work was visiting the sick, inviting non-Catholics to information classes, distributing Catholic literature, encouraging fallen Catholics to return, spreading devotion to the Rosary and helping converts practice their faith. The duties of active members is attend a weekly meeting, recite the Legion Prayer daily and perform an apostolic work weekly” (223:07/11/1993). The Legion of Mass installation Mass was on December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (223:05/12/1993).
