## Church/school furnishings, vehicles and kitchen equipment

### Church and school furnishings

The Guadalupanas, a sodality devoted to the Virgin of Guadalupe, provided vital support to the pastor by paying for maintenance and repairs that the church could not otherwise afford. Sometimes they raised money by selling tamales around Christmas time. In December 1964, the pastor noted that, “The Guadalupanas took in $114 on their last sale of tamales. Very nice work”. He then went on to explain that, “With the consent of the Socias (the members of the Guadalupana society), we hope to buy a new organ. Will the Guadalupanas, the Mesa Directiva, please have a committee inquire into the purchase of an organ?” (223:12/06/64).

A few weeks later, the pastor wrote, “The Guadalupanas would like to present San José with a new Organ for Christmas. They may surprise us. Never underestimate the power of Woman” (223:12/20/64). A week later, he wrote, “Thanks to the devotion and sacrifice of the Guadalupanas, San José has a beautiful organ” (223:12/27/64). The new organ was blessed January 10, 1965 (223:01/10/65).

On September 4, 1966 an announcement in the Sunday Bulletin said, “Any Individual or Group who donates $500.00 for a school room will have a plaque put on the door of that room” (223:09/04/66). The new San José School was under construction at the time and was scheduled to open in October. When the Guadalupanas met in September 1966, they did so in the Guadalupana Room of the new school. He pastor wrote, “Congratulations on the number of Socias, over 100 members. Thanks you for paying for the furniture of the Meeting Room” (223:09/11/66).

In July 1969, Rev. John Haley reported to the Parish Council that the Guadalupanas had set aside $2,000 to remodel the sacristy and rework a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe (213). A year and a half later, the Guadalupanas donated $870.00 for renovations to the kitchen and rugs for the rectory. They paid for new cabinets in the sacristy (223:01/31/71).

During 1972 the Guadalupanas donated $1,985.00 to pay for a cry room and kneelers in the church (223:23/04/72) (223:25/03/73). In June 1975, they sold Mexican dinners for $1.50 (223:08/06/75) and donated $3,000 for the church renovation project (223:13/07/75).

In April 1979, the Guadalupanas purchased another organ for the church. It cost $2,395. This was not the first organ the church had. The Guadalupanas had purchased another 15 years before but the new organ was said to be fancier (223:01/04/79).

In February 1983, the Guadalupanas donated $1,015 to pay for painting the second floor, the stairways and exterior doors of the school (223:27/02/83) and in November they donated $3,000 to help pay for the rug in the renovated church (223:11/12/83). The Guadalupanas donated most of the $6,189 donated to the parish in 1983. The money came from fundraisers such as cake sales (223:13/02/83).

The Sunday Bulletin frequently mentioned individuals who had donated time and labor to maintain the church and the school. The Sunday Bulletin often mentioned that Vincent Flores repaired or donated office equipment such as typewriters (223: 17/02/1985). In 1985, he donated at least three used IBM electric typewriters to the church to replace the old manual machines in the church office (223:17/03/1985) (223:01/09/1985). Also during 1985, Joe Riojas repaired an upholstered chair in the rectory (223:21/04/1985) (223:21/06/1987) and Jim Sanchez and his children donated green, indoor-outdoor carpeting “on the side of the church” (223: 16/06/1985).

### Church vehicles

For many years the parish maintained a vehicle for use by parish organizations. In the fall of 1967, the parish purchased a new 1967 Ford Station Wagon using money given as a gift for that specific purpose (223:08/20/67). Four years later, the parish purchased a green Chevrolet Station Wagon to replace the 1967 Ford Station Wagon. The vehicle cost $3,000 plus the trade-in of the old car. Six organizations contributed $500 each: the Guadalupanas, the Socios, the Community Center, CCD, the PTA and the CYO (223:07/11/71) (223:13/02/72) (223:07/11/71). The donations were listed in the Financial Report of 1971: Donations- Guadalupanas, cabinets in sacristry, $538.00 and Donations-Parish Car, $500 each from Socios, Guadalupanas, CYO, Community Center, CCD and PTA $3,000.00 (223:13/02/72).

While Rev. John Korcsmar was pastor of San José, he allowed parish organizations to use his van. When he left the parish in December 1982, the parish purchased the van from him for $1,000 (223:26/12/82). The van was useful but was found to be too small. Two years later, in March 1984, a meeting was held to discuss the purchase of a school bus for San José to transport renewal teams, Youth Groups, CCD, make trips to San Juan, etc. (223:25/03/84). There were three Mission Teams of 25 to 30 persons each and over 350 youth participated in the various Youth Groups (223:01/04/84).

In May 1984, a used 1982 Chevette was purchased for $4,300 for Sister Eva to use (223:13/05/84). Sister Eva Walsh was the Religious Education Director for the Children and the Youth and Youth Activities. At the same time, the parish ordered a new school bus (nicknamed the Spirit of San Jose) from an agency of Carpenter Body Works in San Antonio. The bus cost $27,334 plus tax, title and license (223:20/05/84). The Ladies of Charity donated $500 toward the bus to help with the Parish Renewals (223:27/05/84). Tom and Rosie Cantu donated $1,000 for the new bus (223:03/06/84).

The bus was delivered and placed in service in August 1984 (223:12/08/84). The bus cost a total of $29,365.30. The money came from various sources. $24,672 came from donations from outside of the parish, $1,903 was raised by parish dances, $1,420 came from donations from parishioners and $1,370 was from the sale of snow cones (223:19/08/84). Thirteen persons volunteered to be bus drivers (223:03/02/1985).

In addition to the school bus, the parish owned the 1982 Chevette car driven by Sister Eva and a Ford Escort. Volunteers maintained the vehicles. In January 1985, Henry Flores and Richard Reyes repainted the Ford Escort (223:06/01/1985). Later Henry Flores serviced, washed and polished the Chevette (223:13/01/1985). Juan Flores repaired one of the parish cars in January 1985 (223:20/01/1985) and, in June, Eloy Garcia washed and polished the Ford Escort (223: 09/06/1985).

The bus was used to take a busload of young people and their chaperones to a national conference in Steubenville, Ohio. After the trip, the youth and young adults who make the trip cleaned the bus (223: 04/07/1985).

In November 1985, the parish sold the van it had purchased from Rev. John Korcsmar three years before and Jim Sanchez helped the Parish negotiate the purchase of a used 1982 Chevrolet ¾-ton pickup truck. The price was $3,650, about half the retail price (223:24/11/1985). Jim Sanchez, Joe Zavala and Bob Haynes maintained the parish bus (223:26/01/1986) (223:14/08/1988).

Henry and Juan Flores were auto mechanics. Juan Flores had a transmission repair shop at 700 W. Jewell Street (223:13/12/1987). He and Henry Flores repaired the cars belonging to the parish (223:12/01/1986) (223:25/01/1987) and Eloy Garcia cleaned and polished them (223:13/12/1987).

In 1991 and 1992, the grand prize for the raffle at the annual Jamaica was used Cadillac cars. Jim Sanchez, who must have been a licensed auto dealer, purchased the cars for the parish. The priests drove the cars prior to their being raffled off. In December 1991, Rev. Joe Devilegher was driving a 1984 Cougar that cost the parish $2,500 while Rev. Underwood was driving a 1987 Cadillac that was purchased for a raffle (223:15/12/1991). Jim Sanchez purchased the used Cadillac for the Mardi Gras drawing, a used Cougar with 75,000 miles for Fr. Devilegher and a used Corsica with 51,000 miles for Fr. Underwood (223:16/02/1992).                

### Kitchen equipment

The kitchen in the San José Community Center was heavily used by both parish and outside groups. For most of the last sixty years, the Guadalupanas volunteered to maintain the kitchen. In October 1961, the Guadalupanas announced that they would have a tamalada Saturday to help buy a deep freeze for the school cafeteria (223:10/22/61). In other words, they would make and sell tamales as a fundraiser to purchase a freezer for the parish hall. They raised $53 that they contributed towards the purchase of a freezer (223:11/19/61).

In August 1969, the Guadalupanas purchased a new stove for the new Community Center rather than move the old stove from the old parish hall. They paid $570 for the new stove and got $68 when they traded in the old one (213). In November, they purchased about $1,000 in kitchen supplies for the new hall (213). Two years later, the Guadalupanas donated $870 for renovations to the kitchen and rugs for the rectory. They also paid for new cabinets in the sacristy (223:01/31/71).

During 1985 and 1986, Frank and Rebecca Ortiz donated a cash register for use by the breakfast groups (223:09/06/1985), Margaret Loera donated restaurant supplies (223: 22/06/1986), Mr. Chano repaired the air conditioner (223: 21/07/1985) and someone else purchased a new icemaker for the Community Center (223: 23/06/1985). In April 1985, the Guadalupanas (Rosemary Martinez, Josefina Garcia, Ruby Roa and Rosie Villalobos) cleaned the kitchen (223: 07/04/1985).

In August 1992, Jim Sanchez, who had a portable food trailer, donated the kitchen equipment he had in the trailer to make a snack bar in the parish hall. The equipment was placed in the room where beer used to be sold at dances (223:23/08/1992) and snacks were sold alongside the regular breakfast menu.

## Grotto

There is a shrine in Lourdes, France located in a shallow cave where Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception appeared in 1858. The Shrine is called the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes or simply the Lourdes Shrine. In 1941, the Southern U.S. Province of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate dedicated a Lourdes Grotto in San Antonio, Texas modeled after the Lourdes Shrine in France. It was made of reinforced concrete shaped to resemble the cave in which the Blessed Mother appeared to St. Bernadette Soubirous in 1858.

Several similar grottos exist in and around Austin. There is a man-made grotto on the campus of St. Edward’s University called Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto. In 1952, a grotto honoring Our Lady of Fatima was constructed at San Francisco Javier Catholic Church near Creedmoor (11)(87). In 1992, when Rev. Fred Underwood was pastor of San José, the parish decided to build a grotto on the campus of San José Church. The parish had built shrine rooms in the new church but fire regulations did not allow burning of votive candles anywhere in the new church (223:13/11/1988).

Until January 1992, a portable building housing a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was located on the parking lot across from the Community Center and between the second and third church buildings. In January, the picture was moved to the old church and the portable building was relocated. The Pastor decided to build a grotto near where the portable building was located “in order to utilize the canopy so crowds can pray in front of the grotto”.  

The grotto is located just off the parking lot on level ground, facing north. The bottom part of the grotto is made of reinforced concrete and the arched upper portion of gunite (a mortar that is sprayed pneumatically onto surfaces at a high velocity). The arched portion is sculpted on the outside to resemble stone.

A statue of Our Lady of Fatima would be placed in the grotto. Unfortunately, someone had borrowed the parish’s statue of Our Lady of Fatima some years before and it could not be located. The statue was described as “white with gold trim, about 3 feet high (223: 09/12/1990). The parish had, however, a suitable statue that was located “under the trees next to the school”. A professional artist was hired to repaint the statue and it became the statue of Our Lady of Fatima (white with gold trim). Donors paid for the grotto and the renovations to the Old Church to house the picture and the grotto was built at no cost to the parish (223:12/01/1992).

The pastor was optimistic that the Grotto would be ready for dedication on Sunday, May 31, 1992. “We will need to leave the supports inside for about three weeks. We will landscape around the exterior of the Grotto and plant sod. The Statue of Our Lady of Fatima is being painted. The Grotto is being paid by donations and income from the Sacred Heart Chapel”, according to Father Underwood (223:10/05/1992).

The grotto is surrounded on three sides by ancient live oak trees rooted in native caliche. The area where the grotto is located slopes gently north, is shaded and has almost no topsoil. The parish had installed grass sod several times in the past in an attempt to provide a cover of grass (223:01/05/83) (223:14/04/89). After the grotto was finished, the Knights of Columbus prepared and sold a barbecue plate in the parish hall for $3 to raise money to buy lawn care equipment and grass for around Our Lady of Fatima Grotto (223:26/07/1992) (223:09/08/1992). The new pastor, Rev. Kirby Garner, paid someone to water the grass two or three times a week but within a few years the area was again exposed dirt.

The grotto is locked at night and opened by the maintenance crew every morning. It is heavily used by devotees of the Lady of Fatima. In 2018, the grotto was the only place on the San José campus where candles were permitted. In 1988, the pastor announced that no votive candles would be burned in the new church until two shrine rooms were built (one for Our Lady of San Juan and one for the Sacred Heart) (223: 17/04/1988). In November, he announced that the, “Two shrine rooms have been completed” for the Virgin of San Juan and the Sacred Heart. Kneelers were in place but Fire Regulations did not allow burning of votive candles anywhere in the new church. “It will be necessary for everyone to burn their own candles in their respective homes” (223:13/11/1988).

## Church Grounds

In 1954, the Bishop of Austin gifted San José Church six acres south of Oltorf Street and west of South First Street for a new church (9). Brother Lambert Barbier of St. Edward’s University and Father Edwin Bauer, Pastor of Holy Family Church, had acquired the land for the purpose of building a medical clinic. At the time, there was no hospital in South Austin and Mexican and Negro residents of South Austin traveled to Holy Cross Hospital for medical treatment. When it became apparent that Religious Sisters could not be found to staff the clinic, the Bishop decided that a new church for San José was a greater priority (12).

The tract belonging to the Bishop fronted on Herndon Lane and South First Street. The portion facing South First Street had been cleared and was mostly pasture. The western part of the tract sloped uphill and was covered by a grove of mature live oak trees. South Third Street, Oak Crest Avenue and South Fourth Street were proposed to cut through the property but, after the Catholic Church purchased the land, the right-of-way for the streets running through the lot were closed. Several lots in the interior of the block to the north of the original tract were purchased so that the property had access to South First, South Third, South Fourth, Oak Crest Avenue, Juanita Streets and Herndon Lane. When the third church was built in 1987, another residential lot at the corner of Oak Crest and Juanita Street was purchased for the new rectory. This brought the size of the church campus to 9.936 acres (3) (12). The street address is 800 Herndon Lane.

José Rocha and Luís Calderón and other men helped clear the brush and trees from the tract. Fr. Houser worked alongside them (12). The first church was built in the interior of the tract, facing a large dirt field that was used as a parking lot. A surplus military barrack was placed opposite the church to serve as the parish hall and the existing rectory was moved from the church’s old location on W. Mary Street and placed on a foundation just east of the first church. Eventually the campus included four permanent structures and five or six portable buildings and sheds surrounded by large paved parking lots.

Until 1985, parishioners maintained the buildings and the grounds. Robert Deolioz was the first full time yard and maintenance man (223: 21/04/1985). The pastor tried to maintain a grass cover around the sides of the church. A 18HP-riding mower with a 44” cut replaced the old lawn mower with 24” cut when the old mower failed in 1985. The new mower cost $2,400 (223:21/04/1985). The parish still relied heavily on parishioners to volunteer their labor and the Sunday Bulletin noted that in April 1985 Enrique Saenz and Ruben Moline used their pickups to clean up around the church (223: 21/04/1985).

When it was decided to build a New Day Care Center in 1985, the pastor asked for volunteers to cut and haul away two or three trees on the spot where he proposed to build the Day Care Center (223: 28/04/1985). The building was never built and a new church was built there instead. The Sunday Bulletin noted that Jim Sanchez helped around the church (223:09/06/1985). Lorenzo Maldonado was the only full-time maintenance man for the parish’s buildings and grounds (223:02/02/1986)

The pastor encouraged parishioners to volunteer by pointing out in the Sunday Bulletin who was doing what to help the church. In July 1985, he noted that Frank Ortega and the Young Adults stripped and waxed the floors in the school (223: 07/07/1985). The helpers included Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ortega, Angel Rivera Jr., Manuel Rodriguez, Paul Sulaica, Isabel Cantu and Yolanda Cantu (223: 21/07/1985). Emilio Cavazos was a radio technician who owned his own business. In 1987, he was often called to repair a loudspeaker system in the church (223:25/01/1987) and to repair microphones (223:10/05/1987) (223:06/12/1987). Enrique Saenz, who was studying to be a deacon, repaired the chain saw and the snow cone machine in May (223:17/05/1987).

Maintaining the grass around the church was a constant concern. In the summer of 1988, Greg Trejo and the Socios purchased and spread dirt on the lawn beside the old church in an attempt to keep the grass alive (223:19/06/1988). The following spring, grass sod was planted around the old church to keep the top soil from washing away (223:14/04/89). After the grotto was built in 1992, the Knights of Columbus sold barbecue to raise money to sod the area around the grotto (223:26/07/1992). The task proved to be hopeless because of the thick canopy of the live oak trees, the heavy traffic on Sunday afternoons and the thin topsoil.

In February 1992, the pastor pointed out that the following persons worked on the church grounds: Wenceslao Ruiz, Arthur Dominguez, Chico Govea and members of the Knights of Columbus including Jose Alcala, Jerry Aguirre, Victor Garcia, Ray Martinez, Pete Sepeda, Ignacio Camarillo and Manuel Garcia (223:16/02/1992). Sylvester Rodriguez, who was a professional sign maker for the US Air Force, painted two signs at the entrance of the church off 3rd Street and Herndon. Ignacio Camarillo cut and trimmed the grass around the church after the spring rains (223:29/03/1992).

Although the city streets that crossed the property were closed to through traffic, cut-through traffic was a constant problem. In January 1989, the circular drive around the grotto area was barricaded. The pastor felt that auto traffic between the school building and Father Joe’s House (the old Convent) had become worse and was a threat to the children’s safety. Parents were asked to accompany their children to class and pick them up after class (223:22/01/89).

## San Jose Religious Articles Store

For many years, the ushers sold votive candles from a table near the entrance to the church after each Mass (223:16/10/1988). Other religious articles, such as Missals and Rosary beads, were often hard to find, especially if the text was in Spanish. Persons who traveled to Mexico often purchased a supply to sell or give to friends and relatives in Austin.

In April 1990, the pastor announced that the room opposite the usher’s room in the foyer of the new church would become a “store” where religious articles and presale of tickets for dances would be sold. The plan was for the store to be open after all weekend Masses. He was seeking two volunteers per Mass to mind the store (223:15/04/1990).

At the end of the month, the pastor was able to announce that the Religious Articles store stocked rosaries, candles, Bibles, holy water bottles, wallpaper, etc. The store was open for business on Saturdays 7:45PM-8:00PM; Sundays 8:45AM-9:25AM; 10:30-10:55AM; 12:00 noon to 12:25PM; 1:30-1:55PM and 7:45-8:00PM. When the store began operations in 1990, the Mass times were Saturday 7:00PM in Spanish; Sunday 8:00AM in Spanish; 9:30AM in English; 11:00AM in English; 12:30PM in English and 7:00PM in English (223:29/04/1990).

The pastor encouraged parishioners to visit the store. He said, “We are very excited about our Religious Article store. The store is open after each weekend Mass (223:27/05/1990). The next Sunday, he announced that the ushers would no longer sell candles after Mass. “We will sell them in our Religious Store and the church office” (223:13/05/1990). In November, the store began opening on Thursday evenings in addition to Saturday and Sunday after all Masses. The pastor urged parishioners to do their Christmas shopping there (223:04/11/1990).

Volunteers ran the store and in August 1991, the Sunday Bulletin appealed for volunteers to mind the Church Religious Store after all Masses on Saturday and Sunday. María Rosas-Garcia was the contact for the store (223:18/08/1991). Later Sherry Joseph took charge of the store and in October she was looking for volunteers to run the store for 30 minutes after each Mass (223:20/10/1991). “Come by the religious store in the church to see the many new religious items we have”, said the pastor (223:19/04/1992).

On May 9, 1993, the Sacred Heart Gift Shop opened in the Sacred Heart Chapel (the old church). This combined the stores that had been in the church office, in the Sacred Heart Chapel and in the new church. The store was open on Sundays and Tuesday and Thursday from 6:00PM to 9:00PM. On May 14, Friday, after 7:00PM Mass, the Sacred Heart Chapel was re-opening with an Enthronement Ceremony (223:09/05/1993). The new hours for the religious articles store were Monday through Friday 12 noon to 9:00PM, Saturday 9:00AM to 9:00PM, Sunday 9:00AM to 3:00PM (223:16/05/1993). Lori Priotti was the contact person for the store in 1993 (223:23/05/1993).

The pastor urged parishioners to do their Christmas shopping in the religious articles store. In December 1993, the Sunday Bulletin urged parishioners to shop at Sacred Heart Books and Gifts Shop. “They are loaded down with many wonderful, inexpensive items for adults and children (223:12/12/1993).

## The Church Bell of San José Parish, Austin

### Texas was part of New Spain

For many years, what is now the State of Texas was a part of New Spain. It was one of the many possessions of the King of Spain. Frontier regions of New Spain that were inhabited exclusively by American Indians were often placed in the care of the Catholic Church and the Spanish military. Missionaries from the Franciscan college in Querétaro in central Mexico established missions in northeastern New Spain and in California. The Spanish military, with headquarters in Mexico City and later San Luís Potosí, sent small detachments of professional soldiers to protect the missions. The soldiers lived in a presidio or fort that was located near the missions they protected. The missions were villages that often included a farm, a ranch, workshops and a chapel as well as residences for the Indian converts and the missionaries.

### The East Texas missions

In 1729, Spanish soldiers occupied a presidio called Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Tejas near the present-day Texas-Louisiana state line. There were three Franciscan missions near the presidio: Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Hainai, San Francisco de los Neches and San José de los Nazonis.

The Spanish king decided to close the presidio and move the troops because, he said, the Indians were peaceful. The real reason for closing the presidio was that the French had gotten control of Louisiana and the Spanish King wanted to concentrate his military forces further south. The missionaries did not want to abandon their missions but were given no choice.

### The missions were relocated to San Antonio

The Viceroy, the King’s representative in New Spain, recommended that all three missions be relocated to Barton Springs. In July 1730, the missionaries and those Indians who wanted to stay with the priests walked from East Texas to Barton Springs. The Franciscans and their Indian converts quickly realized that the terrain at Barton Springs was not suited for irrigated farms. Within months, they petitioned to move to locations along the San Antonio River.

In the spring of 1731, all three missions were relocated to the San Antonio River south of the tiny village of San Antonio de Béxar (now the City of San Antonio). The new missions survived and the descendants of the Indians still live near the old missions. One, San Juan Capistrano, is still an active Catholic parish.

### A mission bell was left behind

The exact locations of the abandoned missions at Barton Springs are not known although there is a historical marker at the south entrance of the swimming pool at Barton Springs. In 1958, the pastor of San José Church, Rev. Joseph Houser, C.S.C., told a reporter that Mr. Charles Dellana accidentally found a bell “some years back”. Houser did not say where Dellana found the bell but Charles Dellana had a ranch near where Zilker Park and Loop One is today. Dellana gave the bell to Rev. Mendez and it was hung in the belfry of the first San José Church on W. Mary Street.

When the congregation moved to the second San José Church south of Oltorf Street, the bell was removed from the belfry of the old church and taken to the new building. However, the bell was not mounted on the church because the new church had no bell tower until 1984. In 1958, Houser kept the bell in the sacristy of the church. According to a newspaper article dated 1958, he said, “In a few months the men of the parish would like to get it back into its pristine dignity enstoned in a shrine”.

### The bell was made in the 17th Century

Houser told the reporter that popular tradition was that the bell was brought from France during the reign of Louis XIV. If so it was made of a type of bronze called bell metal. The bell had a crank or rope arm attached to the yoke to which a rope was attached. Pete Castillo recalls that his father pulled on that rope to ring the bell to call the people to Mass.

This bell should not be confused with another bell that was also moved from the old church. The second bell was an iron bell that was mounted on a wooden and iron frame. This bell had a wheel instead of a crank and was made in America. It was similar to bells commonly used to give warning of a fire or similar disaster. This bell was never mounted on the first church, perhaps because it was too heavy. The bell sat on the ground in front of the first church for many years until it was moved to the second church. It was placed on the ground in front of the building and children used it as a plaything. In November 1964, the bell was repaired, repainted and mounted on a concrete platform so it could be used to call the parishioners to prayer (223:11/22/64).

### The bell tower

In 1984, Rev. Underwood was the pastor of San José Parish. After finishing a major renovation of the church building, he decided to add a bell tower to the existing building.

A drawing of work he planned was included as an insert in the Sunday Bulletin of June 3, 1984. The work consisted of: 1. A bell tower would be built on top of the present brick entrance wall. The bell in the front yard would be painted and installed. 2. Below the bell tower would be a canopy that extended from the front entrance to the next set of steps. 3. An arch of brick would be put around the existing window in the middle of the front wall of the church. The drawing also showed a new entrance on the east side if and when the church needed to expand in the future (223:27/05/84). Fr. Underwood asked for comments and only one parishioner of all who attended the weekend Masses opposed building the bell tower (223:03/06/84).

Construction on the canopy was underway in June (223:24/06/84). Paul Samaniego, Augustine Redondo and Eustolio Treviño helped pour the concrete beam for the canopy and bell tower (223:26/08/84). According to Eustolio Treviño, Fr. Underwood was absent from the church campus when the concrete beams for the bell tower were built. Paul Samaniego had in his possession a second, smaller bell. The men had received instructions to hang the large iron bell that sat on the ground in front of the church. They had no instructions regarding the second bell. In the absence of Fr. Underwood, they decided to hang both bells (223:05/08/84).

If the bronze mission bell from the first church dates back to the Franciscan mission in East Texas, it would be one of the oldest bells in Texas. Besides its value as an artifact of the Mexican Mission of 1940, the bell would be of considerable interest to historians. A similar bell from the Alamo mission in San Antonio recently sold for a quarter of a million dollars. Does the small bell that is hanging on the Sacred Heart Chapel on the campus of the San Jose Parish date from 1729? If not, has the bronze bell gone missing?

## The banner of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus

### The Society is a pious association or sodality

In Catholic theology, a sodality is a pious association of lay men or women organized to perform a specific task. It is a form of the “universal church” just as is the local, diocesan church. The sodalities at San José Church operate inside the church but are not controlled by the pastor. They are independent organizations of laypersons that promote the spiritual works of mercy (related to the Catholic faith) and the corporal works of mercy (having to do with the needs of the body).

Sodalities were first organized in the early Middle Ages in Europe and developed rapidly after the 12th century. Spanish missionaries brought them to the Americas after the Conquest and sodalities became a prominent feature of the Catholic Church in the Americas. There are many sodalities in the San José Church community. Examples of sodalities in the San José Church community include the San José Catholic War Veterans, Knights of Columbus, Movimiento Familiar Cristiano Catolico, La Columna de Fuego, Juventud en Alianza para Cristo, Legion of Mary, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Guadalupanas (the Society of Our Lady of Guadalupe).

### Most sodalities have an insignia

Most traditional sodalities in Spanish-speaking America adopt a distinct insignia. The insignia is usually a badge or ribbon that each member receives when she joins the society and which she is expected to wear at every function of the society. The insignia is the badge of membership. At San José and other Central Texas Catholic churches, a distinctive shirt often replaces the insignia as the badge of membership. The shirt is usually embroidered with the name and symbol of the sodality.

Most traditional sodalities also have a banner. The banner is modeled after the standards carried by Roman legions. Both the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Society of Our Lady of Guadalupe currently use banners. Members of the sodalities carry the banner in processions and display it at functions of the group. In Austin, the tradition of carrying banners in processions outside the church grounds has practically disappeared although it was a common practice as late as 1965.

### Sodalities traditionally received communion as a group

At San José Church, both the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Society of Our Lady of Guadalupe preserve a tradition of processing into the church as a group once a month with their banner. In the 1960s, many sodalities at San José church received Communion as a group at different Mass times. For example, the Society of the Sacred Heart received Communion as a group on the 1st Sunday of the month at the 8:00AM Mass. The Guadalupanas, the Catholic War Veterans and the Parent-Teacher Association received Communion as a group on the 2nd Sunday of the month but at different Masses. These groups processed into the church together with their banners or flags and received Communion together. The solidarity of group communion was strictly enforced and non-members were urged to avoid cutting into the Communion line.

At San José church, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus continues to process into the church as a group on the first Sunday of each month. Traditionally, the Society of Our Lady of Guadalupe processes into the church as a group on the second Sunday of each month. In recent years, both groups often process into the church on the first Sunday of each month.

### The Society was organized in 1939

The banner on display at the annual exhibition is a banner of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Society was organized in 1939 before San José Church was built. The Society was founded in the tiny chapel of the convent where the Sisters who worked at St. Ignatius Church lived. The chapel was located at 307 W. Johanna Street. There the men who collaborated with Rev. Mendez in the Mexican Mission began to plan for the construction of a mission church on W. Mary Street.

Many of the men who began the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus at San José belonged to the Society at Guadalupe Church in central Austin. Among the first members were Luís Calderón, his brother Estanislao Calderón, Antonio Castillo and Simón Botello. Luís Calderón was elected the first President and he purchased the Society’s banner in Monterrey, Mexico. The Society enrolled 26 members in 1940.

### The Society chose the Sacred Heart of Jesus as their patron

The men chose the Sacred Heart of Jesus as their patron because they belonged to a similar society at Guadalupe Church. It is not known why the men of Guadalupe Church chose the Sacred Heart of Jesus as their patron. Most such groups choose the Virgin Mary, usually under the name of the Virgin of Guadalupe, as their patron. The bylaws of the Society at San José bear the imprimatur of Arthur Drossaerts, the Archbishop of San Antonio. Bishop Drossaerts promoted devotion to the Sacred Heart in his diocese and he may have sponsored societies of the Sacred Heart in Austin as well.

The banner on display was a date of 1980 painted on its reverse side. It is not the banner purchased in 1940. Similar banners can be purchased in Mexico City either off the shelf or by special order. The banner currently used by the Society del Sagrado Corazón was purchased about 15 years ago. The Guadalupanas at San José possess three similar banners.

### The San José Society is the last surviving such sodality

At one time, most Spanish-language Catholic churches in Central Texas had similarly named sodalities for adult men. Over time, most of these sodalities became extinct, changed their names or were replaced by groups such as the Knights of Columbus. In 2018, the San José society (Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús) was the only remaining traditional Mexican sodality in Central Texas whose patron is the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

Women’s sodalities have survived in greater numbers. In 2015, there were thirty societies in the Diocese of Austin whose patron is the Virgin of Guadalupe. A few years ago, membership in the Guadalupana societies was opened to both men and women and, in 2018, three men work side-by-side with the Guadalupanas of San José Church.

## Artifacts including Bells, Images and Garments

### Bells

There is a marker located inside the south entrance gate on the south side of Barton Springs Pool that reads: Approximate location of the Missions of San Francisco de Los Neches, Nuestra Senora de la Purisma Concepcion, San Jose de los Nazonis. Established in East Texas by Franciscan missionaries in 1716 for the Christianizing and civilizing of the Indians in the region. Abandoned temporarily due to French incursions from Louisian in 1719. Restored by the Marquis of Aguayo in 1721. Removed to the Colorado River in 1730. Permanently placed on the San Antonio River in 1731 and there known respectively as San Francisco de la Espada, Nuestra Senora de la Purisma Concepcion de Acuna, San Juan Capistrano. Erected by the State of Texas 1936 (Texas State Historical Commission Historical Marker #14883, Atlas # 5507014883, a 1936 Texas Centennial Marker of pink granite with bronze plaque, accessible from Robert E. Lee Road).

The Spanish authorities decided in 1729 to abolish the presidio Nuestra Senora de los Dolores de los Tejas that protected the East Texas missions. The presidio, near present-day Douglass, was unnecessary because of the peaceful demeanor of the Indians. The missionaries of the Franciscan college of Querétaro protested the decision but to no avail.
As a result, the friars decided to move the three missions to a site on the Colorado River near Barton Springs. Vice regal authorities suggested the site but it was found to be unsuitable and within months the missionaries petitioned to remove the three missions to the San Antonio River (The Spanish Missions in Texas, www.texasalmanac.com/topics/Spanish-mission-texas, accessed October 13, 2015.

The three East Texas missions (San Jose de Los Nazonis, San Francisco de los Neches and Nuestra Senora de la Purisima Concepcion de los Hainai) were relocated in July 1730 to Barton Springs. After less than a year at Barton Springs, the three missions removed to San Antonio de Bexar and were reestablished as San Juan Capistrano mission (Spanish Missions Near Barton Springs, www.Texasbeyondhistory,net, October 13, 2015).

The site near present day Zilker Park proved to be unsuitable for the type of irrigated farms favored by the Spanish, probably because the typography of the site. Apparently no attempt was made to dig the necessary irrigation ditches. The terrain below the springs was probably found to be unsuitable for irrigated fields. Because no physical evidence exists, the exact location of the mission has never been determined (Barton Springs, www.edwardsaquifer.net, accessed October 13, 2015).

Two hundred years later, a rancher named Charles Dellana found a bell near Barton Springs. His ranch was located along Eanes Creek near the Colorado River. In 1940, Rev. Mendez, C.S.C., and his congregation began gathering building material to build a church on W. Mary Street. The design for the building called for a stone building built around a framework of cedar posts. Mr. Dellana, who was Catholic, gave the priest permission to gather fieldstone and cedar posts from his ranch located where Zilker Park is today. At that time, Mr. Dellana apparently gave the bell to Fr. Mendez and it was mounted in the belfry of the new church. A photo taken in 1940 of the church shows a wheel-operated bell on the ground next to the building and a smaller bell mounted in the steeple (Photo072, 090). The bell in the steeple was used to call parishioners to Mass and was attached to a rope. When the parish left the building in 1956 and constructed a new church, the bell was removed and taken to the new church. However, the new church had no belfry and nether bell was mounted. In 1956, the wheel-operated bell was placed on a low platform in front of and north of the second church. It was hung from a 2x4. Children would ring it while playing and so disturbed the service.

Fr. Houser kept another bell in the sacristy. In 1958, he said that Charles Dellana found the bell near Barton Springs. He said that the legend is that in 1716 the Spanish planned to build a mission near Barton Springs. Indians drove the Spanish back to San Antonio but the bell was left behind. It was supposedly brought from France during the reign of Louis XIV (120).

It was not until 1984 that a belfry was added to the church. A drawing of the planned bell tower noted that, “Bell in front yard will be painted and installed” in the bell tower. The drawing shows one bell mounted in the bell tower (223:27/05/84). The men that built the belfry mounted two bells. The priest was gone at the time and the men took it upon themselves to mount both bells. According to the Sunday Bulletin, Paul Samaniego donated the bell for the church tower (223:05/08/84).

The Sunday Bulletin of April 7, 1985, had a drawing of the bell tower. The drawing showed one bell hung in the lower rack of the bell tower. The drawing shows that the large bell that sat in front of the church for years is gone (probably hung in the bell tower). The drawing also shows a second, much smaller bell mounted on a support above the lower bell (223: 07/04/1985). It has not been determined whether or not the second, smaller bell is the 17th century French bell or, indeed, what happened to the bell that Charles Dellana found near Barton Springs in the 1930s.

### Sacred Heart Portrait

Ed Brightson donated a framed photo of the Sacred Heart to San José in January 1991. It was kept in a trailer in the parking lot of the church until at least January 1992. It was an object of pilgrimage. In 2017 the photo was on display at the entrance to the 2nd church near the entrance to the Gift Shop entrance. The staff of the Gift Shop said that this is the original photo.
