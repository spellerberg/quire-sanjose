## Adoration

Adoration Catholics believe that at the moment of Consecration, during the Mass, the gifts of bread and wine are transformed (transubstantiated) into the Actual Body and Blood of Christ. This is what is meant by Real Presence, the actual, physical presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. The Catholic Church teaches that Christ instituted this Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist in order to remain with mankind until the end of time. After each Mass, any consecrated host remaining is placed in the tabernacle (a gold box near the altar). During Adoration, the consecrated host (the Body of Christ) is taken from the tabernacle and placed in a monstrance (a gold case) on the main altar and the assembled parishioners are welcomed to spend time with the Lord in prayer. In the early 1960s until at least 1966, Adoration took place all day on the First Friday of every month with three Masses and confessions before each Mass (223:09/29/63) (223:05/01/66). The public came and went on that day, many spending one hour (called a Holy Hour) praying in the church. First Friday Adoration and perpetual adoration are described in other articles.

On February 25-27, 1964, the parish held a “Forty Hours’ Devotion” in which continuous prayer was made for forty hours before the Blessed Sacrament (that had been placed in a monstrance). The pastor asked that only men attend during the night. The devotion began with a Mass of Exposition and ended with a Mass of Reposition. After the Mass of Reposition finished at 5:00PM on February 27, the Blessed Sacrament was returned to the tabernacle accompanied by a procession of all the parish sodalities carrying their banners and wearing their insignia. The pastor asked that the parents prepare girls in white dresses for the procession (223:02/23/64). The parish held another “Forty Hours’ Devotion” on February 21, 22 and 23, 1966. The pastor encouraged everyone to spend a Holy Hour of Adoration each day in the church (223:02/13/66). The Mass on Holy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ. On the night of Holy Thursday after the Mass, the faithful remain in the presence of the Eucharist just as the Disciples kept a vigil with Christ. In 1964 and 1966, the pastor placed the Cursillistas in charge of Holy Thursday adoration from 9:00PM until 7:00AM (223:04/03/66). The next day, Good Friday, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for adoration all day (223:03/22/64) (223:04/03/66).
