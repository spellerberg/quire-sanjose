## Adult Education

From the very beginning of the Mexican Mission in 1939, the Holy Cross Missionaries were aware that most of their parishioners had endured but little religious education. The pastors’ emphasis was, however, on preparing children to receive their first Communion. This was important because, if for no other reason, one of the seven questions on the church’s annual Report to the Bishop was, “How often is Catechetical instruction given to the children?” (1).

The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD) was a sodality or society whose purpose was to teach Catholic doctrine. After 1905, each parish was required to form a CCD. The CCD program was to prepare Catholics to receive the sacraments of Penance (Confession), the Eucharist (Holy Communion) and Confirmation. Naturally, it focused on children and, until recently, instruction consisted of memorizing the Catechism.

Religious education classes in Christian Doctrine were also offered to adults, primarily to train CCD teachers (223:06/02/63). At San José Parish, CCD teachers attended classes Monday through Friday for two or three weeks in the month of July in preparation of the next year’s CCD classes (223:07/05/70). This training was intended for CCD teachers but any parent who was interested was welcome to attend (223:07/12/70).

In September 1964, Father Santo J. Ciatto, C.S.C., an Associate Pastor at San José, started programs for high-school aged youth and adults, apparently for the first time. His program consisted of a Youth Religion Class and an Adult Religion Class. The adults met at 8:00PM on Tuesday in the school. The instructor for the adult class was Father Ciatto while the instructor for high-school students was Mr. Joseph Juárez, a professor of history at St. Edward’s University (223:09/13/64).

### 1970

The schedule of adult religious education class coincided with the CCD (Doctrine/Doctrina) schedule. Classes began in September, October (223:11/08/70) or November (223:11/08/70), were suspended for the Christmas vacation, resumed in January (223:01/14/68) and were recessed during the summer months (223:04/06/72). Classes usually met once a week (223:11/08/70).  

In November 1967, one of US President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society agencies offered to provide teachers and free texts to San José parishioners who wanted to learn English or earn a General Equivalence Diploma. Parishioners were invited to meet in the Parish Hall on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 7:30PM to learn about the program (223:12/03/67). In 1969, GED classes met on Monday and Wednesday nights from 6:30PM to 9:00PM beginning in early September (223:09/07/69). The program continued in 1970-1971 school year when Mr. Porfirio Rios was the contact person for those wishing to register to get their GED (223:08/16/70).

### 1971

At the same time, religious education classes for adults were announced. In 1970, the parish offered seven classes, each with its own text. Parishioners were urged to attend one of them (223:12/13/70). The classes were from 7:30PM to 9:00PM (223:01/24/71). Thirty people attended the class in 1971 (223:02/07/71). After the first seven-week course concluded, another seven week course on a different topic began (223:03/14/71). These classes were offered during the school year through March 1971 (223:03/28/71).      

In the fall of 1971, the classes met at St. Ignatius Church. In January 1972, the adult education classes were moved back to San Jose and met on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7:00PM to 9:00PM (223: 06/02/72). Classes were suspended during the summer and begin again in September (223: 04/06/72).

Prior to 1971, San José Parish formed a Religious Education Board. In 1972, the Board consisted of Mr. Glenn Rosendale, Mr. David Segura, Mrs. Alice Torres, Mr. Rudy Reséndez and Mr. Carmen Cortéz. The purpose of the Board was to guide the CCD (Religious Education) program (223: 16/07/72). In July 1972, the Religious Education Board wrote that the goal of the Religious Education Program was as follows. “The primary goal of the San Jose Religious Education Program is to offer all parishioners the opportunity to develop a Christian way of life. The means to obtain this goal would be through community involvement based on the teachings of Christ and celebrated through Christian worship” (223:30/07/72). The Board asked the parishioners to suggest topics for an Adult Lecture Series.

### 1972

In August 1972, as the parish prepared to close the San Jose parochial school, San José Parish hired a coordinator of religious education to train parishioners for a “total religious education program” (97). The idea was to strengthen the religious education program for both children and adults. Ninety Catechists were trained for grades 1 to 8 (88). Classes for Catechists met on Saturday mornings (223:27/08/72).

The adult religious education program began with a ten-week class on Mexican American Studies beginning September 12, 1972. This class met at 7:30PM on Tuesday in the school building. The leader was Mr. Mario Juárez Cruz. Another class, The Sacrament Study Class, met on Thursday (223: 10/09/72).

### 1973

In August 1973, the Parish Board of Religious Education hired Miss Guadalupe Vela to coordinate elementary school and adult programs and Mrs. Viola Carlisle as coordinator for junior and senior high school youth. Both young women were certified teachers. CCD offered a number of mini-courses for older teenagers and adults. Classes met Monday nights and used seventeen teachers teaching seven courses (101) (249:21/10/73) (249:18/11/73). The courses were: Marriage, taught by Sam and Gloria Luna; Church History, taught by Alberto Garcia and Daniel Ramirez; Morality (The Christian Experience), taught by Rev. Mike Mikan, Raymond Castro and Richard Resch; Images of Faith, taught by Mrs. Teresa Garcia, Mrs. Alice Maldonado and Miss Christine Reyna; Football, taught by Roberto Garcia, David Callahan and Juan Garcia; Contemporary Problems, coordinated by Porfirio Rios and Ben Limón and Bible, taught by Francisco Gonzalez and Tom Álvarez (101).

### 1981

This program proved to be too ambitious and could not be sustained. In 1981, only the adult Bible study remained and it met on every Thursday at the same time as the First Communion classes (223:20/09/1981). The program was revived in 1983 with Adult Classes meeting in the School Building on Sunday mornings from 9:00AM to 10:20AM (223:07/10/1986).
Parents of young children were encouraged to attend Religious Education Classes at 9:30AM- 10:30AM on Sunday and then to attend 11:00AM Mass. There were separate English and Spanish language classes. The program began with a mandatory Renewal weekend that began on Friday night, lasted all day Saturday and was followed by Mass on Sunday (223:14/08/83).

1985-1986

The Adult Education Classes in 1985 were offered in Spanish and English (223: 08/09/1985). These classes were in the school. There were three classes on different topics and a fourth class for those adults preparing to receive the sacraments for the first time. (The term R.C.I.A. was not used.) The teachers included: Victor Balderas, Stella Trejo, Enrique Saenz, Brother William Dunn, C.S.C., Fr. Leonard Paul, C.S.C., Lupe Cruz, Araceli Nieto, Chester Alcalá, Tom and Mary Longoria (223:15/09/1985).

### 1986-1987

In January 1987, the Sunday Bulletin announced a series of twelve classes for adults on Monday evenings from 7:30PM to 9:30PM. The series ran from January 12 to March 30   (223:11/01/1987). The parish asked each adult to fill out a survey (Adult Education Enrichment Survey) to identify topics for adult education classes. Response was not encouraging and the classes taught by the following teachers were cancelled after January 25: Victor Balderas, Deacon Alfredo Vasquez, Enrique Saenz, Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Chaffer and Brother Daniel (223:25/01/1987). The courses that survived included courses named Basic Teachings of the Catholic Faith, taught on Monday nights; Working and Praying for Peace, taught on Monday nights; Improving Communications Between Husband and Wife, taught on Sunday and Las Ensenanzas Basicas De La Fe Católica, lunes por la noche (223:05/04/1987). Some of these classes met in the Community Center (223:08/02/1987). The series ended in April when CCD classes were over for the school year.

### 1987-1988

Adult Education Classes continued on Sunday mornings in the school building in the fall of 1987. Three topics were taught from 9:00AM to 10:00AM. The topics were: Scripture Study, Learning Spanish and Bishop’s Pastoral. This program was separate from RCIA (that met during the week) (223:01/11/1987). Adult Education Classes were suspended from December 13 until January 10 for Christmas. The following persons were the teachers: Mrs. Edelmira Saenz, Mr. Alfredo Chavez, Mr. Luis Calderon and Brother William Dunn, C.S.C. (223: 13/12/1987). Adult Education and CCD Classes began again on Sunday, January 10 after the Christmas break (223: 03/01/1988).

### 1988-1989

On June 11, 1988, a new program of scripture study began in Room 2C of the school. The scripture studied was, “The Revelation to John” (223:11/06/1989). This class ended July 9, 1989.

### 1989-1990

On October 8, 1989, RCIA began to meet in the old church at the same time as the adult Bible study class (223:08/10/1989). The RCIA program was suspended December 17 for the Christmas holidays and ended April 15, 1990 when the candidates were confirmed (223:15/04/1990).

The adult Bible study was called “The Story of Our Faith”. RCIA was called “Journey in Faith”. Adult Bible study class began meeting on October 1, 1989 on Sundays was intended for parents of CCD children. The class was suspended for Christmas and resumed on January 7 and then met until June 3, 1990.

On June 18, a class called “Our Catholic Faith”, met on Monday and Wednesday through August 15. “Our Catholic Faith”, an 8-week summer course, was required for CCD teachers. Fr. Underwood, Deacon Joseph and John Nira taught the class. John Nira was the Director of CCD (223:10/06/1990). The weekly topic was announced in the Sunday Bulletin.

### 1990-1991

After the summer break ended at the end of August 1990, a year-long Bible study class began Sunday and Monday at 9:00-10:30AM and 7:40-9:00PM respectively. Registration was on Sunday, Sept. 9 and 16. This was part of Adult Religious Education. Before this class began, the pastor offered a Saturday renewal called “Life in the Spirit”. This program was on Sept. 15 from 9:00AM until 1:00PM. Life in the Spirit was a day of reflection and prayer for the release of the Holy Spirit (223:26/08/1990).

Beginning January 30, 1991, there were also classes in the old church at 7:00PM for Spanish-speaking adults who wished to learn English (223:27/01/1991) (223:03/02/1991).

Adult Bible Class and Journey of Faith were suspended during the 1990 Christmas Break and resumed in January 1991 (223:06/01/1991). The classes were suspended again during Easter and resumed in April (223:31/03/1991). Topics of the Bible class included: Good News According to Matthew; Our Lord’s Prayer; Preparing for Lent; Daily Reflections for Lent; the growth of the early church and the movement of the Holy Spirit. Topics of Journey Of Faith included: Jesus, Lord & Savior; The Fire of the Holy Spirit; Signs of God’s Love; How Strong is My Faith; How to live the Christian life and develop virtue. Adult Bible Study class met on Sunday mornings in the Parish Hall and Sunday 11:00AM to noon in the Rectory (223:03/02/1991).

The Sunday Bulletin announced that Jesse Martinez would be the instructor of the Spanish-language religious class. The class would meet on Tuesdays in the parish hall at 7:30PM (223:14/04/1991). The theme of each week’s lesson was published in the Sunday Bulletin in Spanish each week (223:12/05/1991). These classes met throughout the summer months under the title “Dios Con Nosotros” with Jesse and Nelda Martinez. The series ended on August 4 (223:04/08/1991) and resumed in October (223:29/09/1991).

Adult Bible Study classes and CCD classes were grouped together in the Bulletin under Religious Education (223:07/04/1991). CCD classes ended April 21. Adult Bible Study continued until May 19 and resumed on June 9. Classes were held on Sunday morning and Monday nights. (223:03/11/1991). San José youth were invited to a Youth Bible Study in the old church on Monday evening beginning in April 1991 (223:07/04/1991). The youth class apparently met all spring and into the summer of 1992.

### 1991-1992

Adult Bible Classes continued to meet on Tuesday at 7:30PM to 8:45PM. The Spanish class was called Dios Con Nosotros and met in the old church. The English class met in the school at the same time (223:05/01/1992). Dios Con Nosotros ended on May 26 for the year (223:24/05/1992). The English Adult Bible Class ended June 2 for the year (223:31/05/1992). After the English Adult Bible Class ended, San José High School Youth Bible study class took this time slot (223:07/06/1992).

The summer religion course was called “Our Catholic Faith”. The class met on Monday at 7:30PM in the parish hall (223:07/06/1992). All CCD teachers were required to attend. The series ended on July 27 (223:26/07/1992).

### 1992-1993

Registration for Adult Bible Class opened on August 30 with classes beginning Sunday Sept. 13. The English-language class was called Adult Bible Sharing-Study Group and met in the Sacred Heart Chapel. Bud Garrett was the instructor (223:23/08/1992) (223:30/08/1992). The Spanish language classes met on Sunday at 10:30AM in the school building. After November 8, the English language class was cancelled because of low attendance (223:08/11/1992). The Spanish language class continued to meet until Christmas (20/12/1992). It resumed and met until April 1993. The class stopped meeting when Father Underwood left the parish (223:04/04/1993).

After April 1993, the Adult Bible Classes were no longer announced in the Sunday Bulletin and apparently stopped meeting. The RCIA classes continued. The Youth Bible Study Class continued to meet on Monday in the old church, led by Jack Salazar and Richard Galvan (223:13/06/1993).

## R.C.I.A./Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults

The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) is a process used by the Catholic Church for prospective converts who are above the age of infant baptism. In 1987, RCIA met Monday or Tuesday at 7:30PM. The RCIA program was sometimes called Journey in Faith/ Crecimiento en Fe at San José (223: 06/12/1987). RCIA was first mentioned in the San Jose Sunday Bulletin in September 1987 but Rev. Underwood had referred to it several years before. In November 1984, he identified the key movements in the Catholic Church as Marriage Encounter, R.C.I.A., Cursillo, Parish Renewal and the Charismatic Movement (223:04/11/84).

When the RCIA program began at San José, the pastor informed the congregation that, “The following persons need to attend: Catholics who have never studied their Catholic faith as adults, Catholics who have studied their faith, inactive Catholics should attend to again become active Catholics, non-Catholics should attend to investigate the Catholic faith”. A Spanish translation of the pastor’s comments was available as an insert in the Bulletin (223: 20/09/1987). RCIA was for persons 17 years of age and older who were interested in becoming a Catholic (223:28/06/1992).

The pastor and John Nira (the Adult Religious Education coordinator) were seeking parishioners who would serve as spiritual friends, guides and sponsors to persons wanting to join the Catholic family (223:04/09/1988) (223:30/07/1989). Each candidate required a sponsor. Fr. Underwood said that, “the Journey in Faith (the RCIA program) was San José’s unique and special way to…prepare you for confirmation (18/10/1988).

Journey of Faith began with a Rite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechmens (223:04/10/1992). The English RCIA classes and the Spanish RICA classes met on different nights in the parish hall or the school from 7:30 to 9:00PM (223: 04/10/1987) (223:01/10/1989) (223:03/02/1991). RCIA classes were suspended for the Christmas break in December and resumed in mid-January (223: 20/12/1987). The English class was ended April and the Spanish ended class in May (223:07/05/1989). Candidates were confirmed on the Vigil of Pentecost, usually in May. The class resumed in September (223: 18/12/1988).

### 1990-1991

RCIA began with an all-day Saturday retreat in the main church that was called a renewal (223:09/12/1990) and continued until the candidates were confirmed in the spring of 1991. On May 18, 1991 (the Vigil of Pentecost) thirty adults were confirmed. Three adults were baptized and eight adults received First Communion on March 30. The pastor suggested that parishioners “begin your own personal Journey of Faith by attending the Pray Meeting on Thursday nights” (223:21/04/1991).

### 1991-1992

During the summer 1991, the RCIA class met with the prayer meeting on Thursday nights until October (223:06/10/1991). After October, the prayer meeting continued to meet but without the RCIA (Journey of Faith) component (223:03/11/1991). RCIA classes met at 6:30PM in separate Spanish and English groups in the school (223:13/12/1992). Journey of Faith met throughout the year until Dec. 20 when it was suspended for Christmas (223:20/12/1992). Over fifty young people and adults attended Journey of Faith classes (223:06/10/1991).

### 1992-1993

In October 1992, RCIA began on Thursday evening with the Rite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechumens (223:04/10/1992). In December, it was announced that Deacon George Joseph would conduct RCIA beginning January 5. Registration was required (223:13/12/1992). When Journey of Faith resumed in January 1993, it met on Tuesday at 7:00PM and at 6:30PM on Thursday with the prayer meeting (223:03/01/1993).

On January 17, 1993, the three RCIA classes met. One met on Tuesday (led by Deacon George Joseph), one met on Thursday in English (led by Larry Thoreson) and another met on Thursday in Spanish (led by Deacon Oswaldo Nira) (223:17/12/1993). After spring break, one English class was moved to 3:00PM on Tuesday (223:07/02/1993) (223:21/03/1993). The 3:00PM class stopped meeting after April 11. The other RCIA class continued until May 1993 when the candidates were confirmed. In February 28, Catechumens and candidates for adult confirmation enrolled their names in the book of the Elect at the 12:30PM Mass. The book was presented to the Bishop (223:28/02/1993). Eighty RCIA students were confirmed on Sunday, May 30 (223:30/05/1993).

### 1993-1994

Journey of Faith Class began on October 12 (223:10/10/1993). English language classes were on Tuesday and Spanish on Wednesday in the school (223:31/10/1993).
