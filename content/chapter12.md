## Advertisers and sponsors

The first San José Sunday Bulletins had a single sponsor, Mission Funeral Home, 1612 East First Street (223: 12/04/60). Mission Funeral Home provided the parish with paper that was preprinted on one side. One of the preprinted pages was an advertisement for the funeral home. The church office staff used a mimeograph machine to print the weekly announcements on the inside two pages. Mission Funeral Home was the sole advertiser from December 1960 until March 1965. In March 1965, the sponsor became Angel Funeral Home, 1700 E. 2nd Street (223:03/07/65).

The two funeral homes were competitors and vied with each other to provide calendars and Sunday bulletins to Hispanic churches in Austin (223:01/12/64) (223:01/02/66). Angel Funeral Home provided the paper for the Sunday Bulletin from March 1965 until April 1972 except for the 1970 calendar year. In 1970, San Jose parish purchased preprinted bulletins from a company called Liguorian Sunday Bulletin located in Liguori, Mo. Instead of an advertisement, pages one and four of this bulletin consisted of a printed message and the program of the Sunday Mass. Pages two and three were one long page of English language announcements written by the staff of the church office (223:01/04/70).

The Liguorian bulletins were printed and the message on page one was a lesson on some aspect of Catholic doctrine. The Liguorian bulletins were professionally done but the parish could not afford the expense. In January 1971, the parish went back to using the paper from Angel Funeral Home that it had used in 1967 through 1969 (223:07/03/71).

Angel Funeral Home supplied the paper for the Sunday Bulletin for the last time on April 2, 1972. The April 9 and 16 bulletins were printed on plain paper. The April 23 bulletin was printed on paper printed with an announcement for Mission Funeral Home (223: 16/04/72). The pastor acknowledged the change in sponsors (223:05/07/72) but did not say what motivated the change. Mission Funeral Home remained the sponsor for one year.

In July 1973, the Sunday Bulletin that was printed on paper supplied by Mission Funeral Home was replaced by a new publication called the CCD Newsletter Volume 1 (248) and Volume Two (249). For the next year, young people employed by the Neighborhood Youth Corps both ran the San Jose Community Center and published the church’s weekly bulletin. At the end of August 1974, the Federally-funded Youth Corps program ended and the Sunday Bulletin returned to being printed on paper donated by Mission Funeral Home (249:05/08/74).

The next month, the San José News replaced the Sunday Bulletin. San José News was an English language publication printed on a double-sided 8 ½ x 11 sheet of paper. The focus of the bulletin was no longer on youth programs and the format was very similar to the old Sunday Bulletins used prior to 1973 (250:12/09/74). In 1976, the parish once again began purchasing Sunday Bulletins from Liguori Publications in Missouri (223:11/07/76).

In March 1979, the parish adopted a new plan for the Sunday Bulletin. Pages one to three remained very similar to the bulletins that used preprinted paper from the two Austin-based funeral homes. However, page four had advertising purchased by a number of local firms. The Houston office of a Chicago-based firm called J. S. Paluch Co. sold the advertising. The advertisers in the first bulletin included Angel Funeral Home, Flamingo Ballroom, Al’s Formal Wear, La Reyna Bakery; Matt’s El Rancho Restaurant, Mission Funeral Home and El Gallo Restaurant (223:15/04/79).

On April 1, 1979, San Jose Sunday Bulletin assumed the form used for the next forty years. The bulletin was printed on both sides of a 11x14-inch sheet of paper by J. S. Paluch Company of Humble, Texas. The single 11x14 sheet was folded into four pages as before. Page four had 36 small rectangles, each with an advertisement from a local business. Page one was the cover page. The cover page featured an image, the church name, address and contact information. Pages two and three were printed announcements written by the pastor and the church office staff.

On June 7, 1981, the Sunday Bulletin announced a new bulletin service (Trinity Publications) was still working on the cover. The pastor urged the parishioners to shop at stores of people who purchase ads for the back of the bulletin. “It is their ads that make this bulletin possible” (223:07/06/1981). Trinity Publications did not change the format of the Sunday Bulletin which has remained essentially unchanged from 1979.

### Advertisers in the Sunday Bulletin, 1979- 1987

In April, 1986, the pastor announced that, “Mr. Isaac Cisneros will be working here at San Jose this week. Mr. Cisneros is the gentleman that works with the ads in our bulletin. He will be here to renew the current ads and also add any new sponsors” (223:27/04/1986). The pastor noted in April 1993 that Dennis Cannon of Trinity Publications was in the Parish office to renew ads on the back of the bulleting (223:18/04/1993). The name was later corrected to Dan Ozuna (223:25/04/1993). These men made minor changes to the list of advertisers as needed throughout the year.

The following is a list of the advertisers on the date noted. The list is of those firms advertising in the Sunday Bulletin on the Sunday nearest the 1st of July of each year. Advertisers usually kept their ads in the bulletin for at least a year so this list contains the names of most, but not all, firms that helped pay for the Sunday Bulletins between 1979 and 1987. Many of the advertisers were parishioners. That fact was usually, but not always, noted in the ad. The Mission Funeral Home and Matt’s El Rancho Restaurant both had an advertisement in the San Jose Sunday Bulletin of April 1979. These two sponsors appeared in each Sunday Bulletin from 1979 until the July 5, 1987 issue.

## Biographies

### Calderon, Estanislao

The following brief biography was printed in the Program of San José Church Bazaar and Dance, Sunday, May 4, 1975. The program is in the possession of Alice Maldonado.

“Estanislao Calderon was born May 5, 1887 in Hacienda Trejo, Guanajuato, Mexico. His family migrated to Texas during the Mexican Revolution. He has been living in Austin since 1913.
Mr. Calderon has 5 sons, 5 daughters, 47 grandchildren and his great grandchildren number in the 70s. When the Calderon family gathers to celebrate his birthday, they are so many that they stand shoulder to shoulder in his front yard.
He has lived in South Austin since he settled in Austin and remembers when Father Mendez (presently Bishop Mendez) built the original church on West Mary. In fact, he and his son-in-law helped build it. Prior to the building of the church, he remembers having to go to Our Lady of Guadalupe Church to have his children baptized.
Father Houser, CSC, affectionately nicknamed him “Tio” many years ago when he worked as a gardener for San Jose Church. That is the name he answers to now. He worked for the church for about fifteen years. Although he says he is semi-retired, he still likes to mow lawns for what he calls “pocket jingling money.” He has a beautiful garden he works on every day. He is so active that his daughter has threatened to tie him down, but he boasts that we would manage to escape. His doctor advised him to slow down, but he still insists on walking to church every Sunday. He said he felt safe because God will take care of him since he knows he’s on his way to visit him.
He is a past officer of Sagrado Corazón de Jesús. He is looking forward to a long life and is presently remodeling his home. He loves company and welcomes any visitors to his house” (237).  

### Calderon, Luis Z.

Much of the following is from “Interview with Luis Calderon”, Austin, TX, June 9, 1978 in the Catholic Archives of Texas, Austin, Texas. The researcher was Brother William Dunn, C.S.C. of St. Edward’s University. Other sources were Federal Census for 1930 and 1940, the City Directory and area newspapers.

Luis Calderon was a younger brother of Estanislao Calderon and immigrated to Texas with his brother and his parents in 1905. Luis was born in Guanajuato and moved with his parents to Texas when he was ten years old. The family lived near Lockhart from 1905 until 1911 when they returned to San Carlos, Coahuila to grow cotton. The next year, he and his parents left Coahuila and found work on a ranch in Dripping Springs, 26 miles from Austin. In 1915, the family moved to Travis County. They traveled to Austin every two weeks in a mule-drawn wagon to purchase food and attend Guadalupe Church, that was then located between 5th and 6th Streets in West Austin. On April 2, 1919, Luis married Beatríz Mosqueda at St. Mary’s Church at Lockhart (3).

In 1930, he worked as a tenant farmer on Manchaca Road in Travis County. In 1939, he met Fathers Alfredo Mendez and Thomas Culhane and was enrolled as a founding member of San José Catholic Church. In 1940 he lived in what is now South Austin and worked as a carpenter and rock mason. His household consisted of his wife Beatrice and ten children, Rafael (Ralph) age 20, Narciso age 17, Leonora age 15, Jesús age 13, Dolores age 11, Hortencia age 10, Enrique age 8, Maria age 6, Miguel (Michael) age 4, Guadalupe age 2,  and Beatrice age 7/12.

He belonged to the Sociedad del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús at Guadalupe Church and received permission from Rev. Mendez to begin a society at the San José mission. He, his brother (Estanislao Calderon) and Antonio Castillo were the first members of the society. In May or June 1942, Luís left Austin to work in Vishfield, Ohio (3). He soon returned to Austin and lived on a small ranch south of Austin in the community of Vinson.

In 1944, Luís, his wife and his seven daughters and six sons moved from the ranch to a house near San José church. In December 1946, Luis and his wife adopted Anna María (3). In 1952, he and his wife owned a grocery store at 1801 S. 1st Street (1952 City Directory) where his family also lived.

Luis was involved in many activities at his church. In the 1950s and 1960s, he helped organize and officiate at the annual Church bazaar. The men’s society at San Jose Church, of which he was the President, managed María De La Luz Cemetery on a voluntary basis for many years. In January 1965 the pastor, Father Houser, appointed Luis to direct the Men’s Retreat in early June 1965 at St. Edward’s University (223:01/31/65). He was elected to the San José Parish Council (223:08/17/69).

After San José Church moved to a new campus south of Oltorf Street in 1957, Luis purchased the first San José church building and the vacant lot next to it on W. Mary Street (193). He rented the church building as a residence and built a house on the vacant lot. His wife, Beatríz, died in 1964 (3) (223:11/21/65) (223:12/19/65). In 1966, Luis married his second wife, Jesusita, a lady who was born in Mexico and lived in San Marcos (3).

In August 1969, Luis Calderon moved to Montopolis. He sold the old church building on W. Mary Street in 1974. He died in August 1979 and was buried in Assumption Cemetery (Austin American-Statesman, August 9, 1979).

### Castillo, Pete

Most of what follows was based on an interview with Pete Castillo on July 21, 2015 at Pete’s home at 2008 S. 3rd Street, Austin conducted by Philip Mullins.

In 1930, a number of Mexican families lived side-by-side north of Johanna Street at W. Mary and W. Monroe Streets just west of South First Street in South Austin. Some families, such as the Caramona and Rieces families, owned their homes. Others, such as the Flores and Pete’s parents, were renters. Pete was born in 1931 in the rented house on W. Monroe Street. His father, Antonio Castillo, later purchased a lot on S. 6th Street and used scrap lumber to build a shed on the lot. Pete’s father worked in construction at the time. Antonio later added a door and a small kitchen to the shed but there was no running water and no bathroom. The family used an outhouse and the mother a cast iron wash pot in the back yard. Later, the City laid water and sewer lines and the gas company laid a gas line to the street and Antonio paid to hook up his small house to the new utility lines. In 1939, Antonio Castillo worked for a man named Mr. Dawson. Mr. Dawson sold Antonio Castillo an old house located on Live Oak Street and the family moved the house onto the lot on S. 6th Street.

In 1939, when Pete was seven years old, Becker Elementary School was built nearby. Pete’s mother enrolled him at Becker school and Pete attended school there until he finished the 6th grade. He then went to Fullmore School on Congress Avenue for the 7th and 8th grade. He attended Allan Junior High School, located at the corner of 9th Street and Trinity Street, for the 9th grade. He finished the 9th grade when he was 14 years old.

Beginning when he was six years old, Pete went with his parents to pick cotton during the months of June and July. They went to Port Lavaca where his mother and Pete’s old brother Joe worked for a German man who had a farm. They returned to Austin in time to enroll in school. After finishing the 8th grade, Pete and his brother Joe began to work with their uncle. His uncle contracted with men who owned trucks to carry the boys to surrounding counties to pick cotton. That year, Pete and Joe were taken to Lubbock where they picked cotton until Christmas. They returned to Austin and Pete enrolled in Allan Junior High School. He attended school from January until May. After finishing the 9th grade in May, he went to live with his sister near Temple.

For two summers, he worked for a taxidermist in Temple. The first summer, he made plaster deer heads. The second year, he stuffed horned toad skins that were to be sold as souvenirs. The third year, he picked cotton around Temple. That year, he got a Social Security Card and starting working in Austin in a factory that made cedar awnings for windows. The next year, when Pete was 18 years old, he was hired by the Willard Manufacturing that was located in the three-story building at 220 S. Congress Avenue a block south of the Congress Avenue Bridge. He was hired to make metal-covered wooden footlockers.

When Pete was sixteen, he joined the National Guard. He belonged to the 49th Company of the 36th Quartermaster Corps. When Pete joined the unit in 1947, all the men were Mexicans. They trained at Camp Mabry on Tuesday nights. In the summer, they trained at Fort Hood. The company had three trucks. The first summer, the company was assigned to carry troops to Hillsboro. The second summer, the company was assigned to carry troops to Luling and then to Fort Hood. In 1949, after two years with the Guard, he came into conflict with the unit officer over money that Pete needed to pay for medical expenses. He subsequently left the unit.

That year Pete worked for a factory that made venetian blinds and clothes hangers for football uniforms. When the contract was finished, Pete traveled to Taft near Corpus Christi to pick cotton. In the spring, he and a friend, Mr. Botello, got work hoeing cotton and, in the summer, the two men went to Morgan, Texas, where they worked for Pete’s brother-in-law picking up pecans on shares. The next year, Pete’s brother-in-law became a cedar chopper and Pete was hired to run his brother-in-law’s cedar post yard. Pete’s job was to sell the posts that were supplied by his brother-in-law. After this experience, Pete leased a pecan bottom on the University of Texas Austin campus. Later, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum were built in the site of the pecan grove.  He harvested and sold the pecans.

In 1951 Pete was drafted into the US Army for two years during the Korean War. He was sent first to Fort Sill and then to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland for ten weeks of training. He was assigned to the 145th Engineers and then the 444th Ordinance Company. After his enlistment was over, he returned to Austin and enrolled in a trade school to learn cabinetry. The Veterans Administration paid him $160 a month while he was in school. In December 1953, Pete married and, in 1956, he purchased the house at 2008 S. 3rd Street where he still lives. He and his wife had eleven children.

Between 1954 and 1955, Pete worked at a factory in Austin that made windows. Beginning in 1955, he worked for 2 ½ years for a man named Mr. Falmar. Pete quickly learned the process and became what was called an “all-around” man, meaning he could work at any work station in the factory. However, Mr. Falmar did not pay what Pete thought were competitive wages. Mr. Falmar fired one of Pete’s co-workers when the man asked for a 15 cent per hour raise. Pete later quit for the same reason. When Pete left, he was earning $86 per week plus overtime. That was the prevailing wage for factory workers in Texas at the time. After Pete left the plant, it closed because of an expensive error involving imported window frames.

After leaving the window factory, Pete worked with his brother Lee building houses. From 1960 until 1965, a painting contractor hired both men to do taping, floating, texturing and interior painting. From then on, Pete worked as a painter. In 1974, he advertised his services for taping, floating, painting and acoustical spraying in the San Jose Church Samaritan newsletter (249:20/01/74).

Pete and his family were active members of the San Jose Church community. He and his father helped build the first church on W. Mary Street. Pete and the other young boys who were acolytes mixed and carried cement to the stonemasons. They served as altar boys at the Sunday morning Mass and then accompanied the priests on their trips to the mission stations. Antonio Castillo was one of the first member of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and, at his mother’s insistence, Pete joined the group after returning from the army in 1953. However, Tony Cruz, Luís Calderón and José Rocha did not create space in the organization for the younger men. The younger men were discouraged from speaking at the meetings and many of them left the organization.

Instead, Pete and many of the younger men joined the Catholic War Veterans Post 1085 when it was organized in 1957. He was one of the eighteen men who founded the San Jose Post and is still a member. The Veterans agreed to help with the Boy Scout program at San José and from 1953 to 1955, he was Assistant Scout Master of the San José Boy Scout Troop #94.

The Veterans later volunteered to usher for the 10AM Sunday Mass and Pete joined them. In this way, he became an usher at San José Church. Pete was later placed in charge of the ushers at the 8AM Sunday Mass that the Socios had previously handled. Pete served as an usher at the Vigil Mass on Saturday until about 2016. For many years, he was the head usher for the 10AM Mass and then the 12:00PM Mass. At the 12:00PM Mass, teenagers helped with the collections. Once the teenage ushers left their stations and retired to the church bus that was parked outside. Pete tried to discipline the teenagers but the Sister who was in charge took the children’s side and fired Pete from his job as overseer. After that he helped usher at the Vigil Mass on Saturday.

Pete was appointed to the Parish Council in May 1970 when Rev. Haley was the pastor of San Jose. He agreed to finish out the term of his brother Manuel. Pete was elected to the Council in August and served as the Chairman of the Youth Committee. He served on the Council until it stopped meeting in June 1971 after a dispute with the pastor.
In 2004, when María De La Luz Cemetery was designated a Historical Cemetery, Pete Castillo was Vice President of the Cemetery Association (145).

Pete’s brother, Manuel Castillo, was the president of the 25th Anniversary planning committee in 1963 (223:11/03/63) and also served on the 50th Anniversary planning committee 1989 (242). The 50th Anniversary committee tried and failed to produce a history of the church. When Father Tom Frank announced plans for a 75th Anniversary celebration in 2014, Pete volunteered to help. He, Esther Terrazas and Philip Mullins began compiling information for a history of the parish.

### Delanna, Charlies

In 1900, Charlies Delanna Sr. (who was born in northern Italy) and his wife Rosa (who was born in Louisiana) were living on W. 4th Street in Austin with two sons, Charlie Jr. born 1892 and Johnny born 1896 (1900 Census). The younger Charlies Delanna was described as an Octoroon, meaning that he was one-eighth Black by descent (1910 Census). In the 1920 Census, he was described as a white stock farmer who owned a ranch at Eanes School House.

In 1930, Charlies was married and living on Bees Caves Road in Precinct 5 with his wife, three children and his mother. He was a farmer who owned his land (SD24 ED 227-50). By 1940, Charlies still owned his ranch and described himself as a farmer but his neighbors included a civil engineer, a printer and an auto body mechanic (SD 10, ED 227-80). The area was no longer ranchland. It had become a mixed residential and rural neighborhood. Between 1917 and 1931, a banker named Andrew Jackson Zilker sold 350-acres of land surrounding Barton Springs to the City of Austin (32). This land abutted the Delanna Ranch. The City created Zilker Park and the land west of the park, including Delanna’s ranch, became an upscale residential area.

In 1940 Mr. Delanna, who was Catholic and a parishioner of St. Mary’s, allowed Rev. Mendez and his helpers to take fieldstone and cedar posts from his ranch for use in the construction of a church for Mexicans that to be located on W. Mary Street in the Bouldin Addition neighborhood (69). The church was three miles from Delanna’s ranch. The church building was constructed of stone largely taken from the Delanna ranch (70).    

Some years before, Mr. Delanna found a bell near Barton Springs. He gave the bell to Mendez and it was mounted in the bell tower of the new church (69). It was used to announce the Mass. The legend is that in 1716 the Spanish planned to build a mission near Barton Springs. Indians drove the Spanish back to San Antonio but the bell was left behind (120). When San José Parish relocated to its new campus south of Oltorf Street, the bell was removed from the building at 715 W. Mary Street (70) and stored in the sacristy of the new church (120). It has since disappeared.

The Charlies Dellanna family also donated the land where the old Knights of Columbus Hall was built. The old KOC building is now located at 2401 Columbus Drive inside of Zilker Park but the hall was outside the city limits when it was constructed (142). It is located on the height of land about 3/16 miles from the intersection of Dellana Lane and Rollingwood where the Dellana farmhouse likely stood (Pete Castillo). The old KOC hall is now called McBeth Annex. Charles F. Dellana died in 1973 and is buried in Mount Cavalry Cemetery on Manor Road in Austin.

### Gomez, Margaret

The following is a summary of a biography that appeared in the Program of 20th Anniversary Banquet, Mexican American Business and Professional Women’s Association, Saturday, October 15, 1994. The original is in the possession of Alice Maldonado.

In 1983, Margaret Gomez was listed in the San José Bulletin as the contact for a Catholic peace group called Network. She also organized a public hearing for a school bond election in January 1983 at San José Community Center (223:16/01/83).

“A homegrown community leader and loyal, Margaret Gomez has worked in local, state and national political circles since 1969. Launching her own race in 1980 for Travis County Constable, Precinct 4, Margaret defeated a 14-year incumbent. This year (1994), Margaret was elected Travis County Commissioner for Precinct 4 and will take office January 1, 1995 as the first Mexican American woman county commissioner. Margaret is a consensus builder and is a strong advocate for children and families. Margaret serves on the Board of Directors of Austin Comes Together and remains active in community issues. Twice named “Fund Raiser of the Year” by the East Austin Optimist Club, Margaret also received an award in 1993 for her accomplishments by the Austin Año de la Mujer Committee. She participates in Allison Elementary School’s Career Day and volunteers with Reading Is Fundamental (RIF). Margaret also serves on the Board of Directors of the Girl Scouts and is a mentor with the CAMP program at St. Edward’s University. One of our own, Mexican American Business and Professional Women’s Association (MABPWA) proudly salutes Margaret Gomez as she launches her future as Travis County Commissioner” (241).

### Gonzalez, Paul A.

The following biography appeared in the Program of San José Church Bazaar and Dance, Sunday, May 4, 1975. The original is in the possession of Alice Maldonado (237). Additional information is from the San José Sunday Bulletin.

Paul Anthony Gonzalez was born in Austin, Texas on September 29, 1959 to Francisco and Mary Gonzalez. Paul’s mother was born in England. Mr. Gonzalez met her while he was in the Air Force and stationed in England. The Gonzalez family moved back to Austin six years ago. Paul has lived in California and England. He has two older brothers and two younger sisters.

Paul is a very familiar sight at Travis High School. He admits he likes school and wants to continue his education after graduation from high school. Paul is a sophomore. His activities at school include serving as treasurer of the Pan American Student Forum (and) Past Parliamentarian of the Student Council. He is also a member of the Chess Club. He very modestly admitted that he has never lost a game. The Travis High School newspaper, “The Southerner,” did a feature story on Paul in the November issue.

Paul spends quite a bit of his spare time helping Rev. Mike Mikan around the church. Paul is getting all the experience he can because he plans to be a priest. He is one of the many people who are going to Mexico this summer to help with the mission at San Rafael. San José Church is joining with Montopolis again this year with the mission project. The group plans to go by caravan in three vans. Paul and his family reside at 506 South Park Drive, Austin (237).

In October 1978, the San Jose Pastor, Rev. John S. Korcsmar, CSC, referred to Paul Gonzales in the Sunday bulletin, “We will have a turkey dinner (we all know Paul Gonzales is usually stuffed, but can he fit in one of those ovens?). (By the way, on one of the questionnaires that was turned in a couple of weeks ago, there was a comment about not picking on Paul so much and using him as an example. I wish his mother weren’t so sensitive!)” (223:29/10/78). Rev. Korcsmar was known for his sense of humor and frequently reprinted jokes and humorous sayings in the Sunday Bulletin (223:07/06/1981).

In December 1978, the pastor wrote in the Sunday Bulletin that “…there will be a meeting at the home of Frank and Mary Gonzales, 506 South Park. (They promise that Paul won’t be home so that everyone will have a good time)” (223:03/12/78). Paul was an employee of the church for several years (223:15/04/79), first as an Administrative Assistant (223:11/07/82) and then as the director of the San José Community Center (223:27/03/83).

While he was employed by the church, he also worked as a disc jockey. He advertised his business in the Sunday Bulletin as Silver Express Disc Jockey and listed his address as 2425 Oak Crest, the address of the church. Since mobile telephones did not exist, he listed the church telephone in his advertisements as his day telephone and his parent’s telephone as his evening telephone (223:25/07/82).

Paul was the driving force behind the mission to Mexico and continued to accompany the Mission Group to Ahuactalán until the summer of 1982 (223:11/07/82). He was immensely popular and his birthday was announced in the Sunday Bulletin (probably as a joke) (223:10/10/82).

During the summer of 1983, he managed the San José Community Center, a popular site for dances (223:27/03/83). Paul worked as a disc jockey until at least 1986 and donated his services for benefit dances (223:25/11/84). He continued to work in the youth program as a young adult. In February 1986, the San José Youth Drama Group, directed by Paul Gonzales, participated in a One Act Play Competition at St. Monica Catholic Church in Cameron. Seven groups presented plays (223: 09/02/1986). The group from San José Parish came in 2nd place in the competition (223: 02/03/1986).

### Maldonado, Alice

This biography of Alice Maldonado was printed in the Program of 20th Anniversary Banquet, Mexican American Business and Professional Women’s Association, Saturday, October 15, 1994. The original is in the possession of Alice Maldonado.

Alice has been a friend of youth through San Jose Catholic Church and other organizations for almost 30 years. Working full time and raising a family has not kept Alice from giving of herself as a volunteer for “at-risk youth”. Alice and her family have made youth involvement a priority in their lives. Her approach is simple-she teaches youth the importance of family, tradition and religion. Mrs. Maldonado has taken youth to Mexico to learn of others’ hardships and how to give of themselves. Following in her footsteps is her daughter, Cindy Martinez, who has also received city-wide recognition for her work with “at-risk youth”. Alice does not depend on public funding to perform her work with youth. Her efforts have been underwritten through personal funds and with help from the Austin business community. Alice’s goals are to keep kids in school, off drugs and out of gangs. And she has been a success. Her Catholic upbringing and involvement in the San Jose parish has taught Alice Maldonado to give from the heart. Alice Maldonado is recognized by Mexican American Business and Professional Women’s Association (MABPWA) as a woman “con Corazon de oro” (241).

In September 1984 Bishop Harris re-appointed Joe and Alice Maldonado to their 4th term as Moderators for the Austin Catholic Youth Deanery (223:23/09/84) and they continued to volunteer their time to San José Catholic Church until at least 2018.     

### Rev. Alfredo Mendez, C.S.C.

Rev. Alfred E. Mendez Gonzalez was born in 1907 in Chicago, IL. He was ordained a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross on June 24, 1935 in Washington, D.C. and arrived at St. Edward’s University in 1936 shortly after his ordination (72). In 1937 he worked as an instructor at St. Edward’s University (1937 Austin City Directory, pg. 441). He took charge of the Mexican Mission that was preparing to build Santa Rosa Church at Andice, 38 miles north of Austin (72). It is said that he established eleven missions in the Diocese of Galveston, north of the Colorado River.

He took a sick leave in January 1937 and upon his return to Austin was assigned to St. Helen Church in Georgetown (History of St. Helen). In August 1939, while a patient in a hospital in San Antonio, Mendez was invited by the Bishop of San Antonio to build a Mexican church in the Diocese of San Antonio (9). To this end, he began to hold Spanish-language services at St. Ignatius, Martyr, Church that was then located at 303 W. Johanna (1939 Austin City Directory). In July 15, 1939, Mendez received permission to begin a Mexican Mission the Diocese of San Antonio in collaboration with Rev. James Donohue and Rev. Joseph Houser (72) (73). In April 1940, he described himself as President of the Mexican Mission (1940 US Census) and, in 1941, as the pastor of St. Joseph’s Church (1941 Austin City Directory).

San José was originally called St. Joseph’s Mexican Catholic Church (70). It was a national church without parish boundaries. By February 1942, it was called Misión de San José (74). The purpose of the Mexican Mission was to found a “national” church for Mexican immigrants. In 1939, the system of racial segregation known as Jim Crow was still being developed and, since Mexicans and Blacks were not welcome at Anglo churches, separate churches were created for them. Before 1940, Holy Cross Fathers from St. Edward’s University created San José parish for Mexicans, St. Ignatius, Martyr, for Anglos, and Holy Cross Parish for African-Americans (4). Rev. Alfred Mendez was tasked with creating the Mexican church (36).

By the end of 1940, the Mexican Mission had established three missions (including a Mother Church in South Austin) and serviced five preaching stations in southern Travis County. By 1942, Mendez was in charge of four missions and ten preaching stations. The missions had practically no income and between 1940 and 1948, when a rectory was built for San Jose Church, Mendez lived in private homes or at St. Edward’s University (1940 Census) (Austin City Directory).

Mendez had many collaborators. He was helped by Holy Cross Sisters from St. Mary’s Academy and several young priests from St. Edward’s University including Fathers Thomas Culhane, James Donnelly, Peter Mueller, Joel Atwood, Elmer Vincent Rupp and Brother Anthony Weber. Rev. James Donohue, a retired priest who had been the Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, was his Associate Pastor (4) in 1940. Arthur Fehr, a young architect who later became quite famous, designed the first three mission buildings and Charlies Delanna, a local ranchman, donated building material for the mission buildings. The men who built the first four mission churches were parishioners of the mission in South Austin. Father Mendez was much admired by his parishioners for his generosity and selflessness (70).

Mendez was pastor of San José Church and its three or four missions from 1939 until 1948. His successor was one of his earliest collaborators, Rev. Joseph Houser, CSC. Father Houser was pastor of San Jose for almost twenty years, from 1948 until 1967 (211). On October 28, 1960, Mendez was ordained Bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, his ancestral home. He was the first bishop to make a Cursillo retreat and brought the Cursillo movement to Puerto Rico as soon as he arrived there. He welcomed change in ancient practices, encouraged Holy Cross Sisters to update their habits and encouraged the appointment of permanent deacons. He was a member of the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM) that promoted the theology of liberation. He retired in January 1974 and moved to Carlsbad, California.

He became a controversial figure in 1990 when he ordained two seminarians of the Society of St. Pius V (SSPV) that was considered by the Vatican to be a splinter group. His Latin was rusty and the ordinations remain controversial. He was in poor health. In October 1993, he ordained an ultra-conservative priest as Bishop of the Society of St. Pius V (SSPV) and became the center of a factional struggle between the Vatican and the SSPV. Rev. Mendez died in Cincinnati in January 1995.

### Amelia (Molly) Resas

Mrs. Amelia (Molly) Resas was a longtime resident of South Austin. When Father Mendez requested help from the community to raise funds for a new church in 1940, she and the ladies of the church community began having “reunions” of day-long, family-oriented activities and fellowship to raise money for the church. These events evolved into the annual church Jamaica.

After the church was built, Mrs. Resas created the organization of the Guadalupanas at San José Parish. With the blessing of Rev. Mendez, Mrs. Resas invited the ladies of the new parish to join the society and in this way begin the Guadalupanas. Mrs. Resas recounted how the Guadalupanas would provide meals for the young priests, welcoming them into their homes. Today the organization is the primary support for the parish priests and the needs of the church in devotion to the Blessed Mother. The Guadalupanas coordinate the annual celebration of the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12 at San José Parish (229).

### Sister Gloria Rodriguez, M. J. M. J.

## Dance Bands

According to Rev. Houser, “fiestas” were, until recent years, the primary source of funds for San Jose Church. Funds from fiestas were used to purchase equipment and construct parish buildings as well as to finance the activities of parish organizations. Occasionally, fiestas are used to raise funds for needy parishioners (223:12/06/83) and those with large medical bills (223:02/12/84).

Until the middle 1990s, “fiestas” usually involved dancing and the consumption of alcoholic beverages, usually beer (249: 02/12/73). Large quantities of beer were sold at parish-wide fund raising events in the spring and fall of each year 734 (223:07/11/82). Pastors tolerated drinking by adults as a necessary evil and recognized that it was an important part of both fund raising events and social life (223:17/06/84). In 1961, the Pastor commented that, “The San José Dance in the Coliseum was a beautiful event with no drunkenness” (223:09/10/61). Texas law allows religious organizations to sell alcoholic beverages but policies of the Diocese of Austin now discourage it. Currently, drinking beer on the San Jose church grounds is forbidden.

In the early 1940s, dances were held on a platform erected behind the church. After a parish hall was built east of the church at 711 W. Mary, dances were held there. In 1948, this single story building was torn down and replaced by a two-story rectory. After the Rectory was built, dances sponsored by the parish took place at a City of Austin facility, either the Coliseum or, after 1959, the City Auditorium. Both venues were located on the south shore of the Colorado River, two miles north of the church.

Events at the City Auditorium and the City Coliseum were quite popular and attracted large crowds. The Coliseum was a repurposed WWII aircraft hanger while the City Auditorium (now called Palmer Auditorium) was a modern brick building. The City Auditorium was the larger space. San Jose used the Coliseum for its Annual Coronation of San José Queen event from 1955 until at least 1962 (12). Lay organizations from San Jose parish pooled their resources and sponsored dances at the Coliseum as fundraisers (223:02/25/62) (223:03/11/62).

After 1962, large events were held in the City Auditorium (213). Perhaps typically, in 1966 the Dance Committee sponsored a dance at the City Auditorium and raised $166 for the church. In a time when the minimum wage was $1.25, this was considered a successful fundraiser. After 1969, all such events were held at the San José Community Center (223:07/02/67).

After 1956, when San José Church was relocated to its current campus on Oak Crest Avenue, the parish purchased a military surplus barracks and converted it into the parish hall. But this parish hall was small and events continued to be held in City-owned facilities at Auditorium Shores. Large events were held at the City Auditorium until 1976 but smaller events, such as dances sponsored by parish organizations, were held in the San José Community Center after it opened in 1969.

In September 1969, the parish dedicated the new San José Community Center, an air-conditioned building measuring 60 by 112 feet. The new building was the parish hall but it was also rented out for events that served the surrounding community. The new building also proved to be an ideal venue for dances. Its maximum capacity was 400 persons (223:01/05/1988). Prior to 1970, the parish sponsored three or four dances each year. Dances were part of the two large parish-wide events held in the spring and fall of the year and there were often dances on Mother’s Day, Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve. After the San José Community Center became available, the number of dances sponsored by the parish increased to a dance every two weeks.

In 1970, various lay organizations in San José Church sponsored 16 dances at the Community Center. In 1971, 38 dances were held in the Community Center, an average of three dances per month. Many of the dances were fundraisers. Most dances charged an entry fee of $1.50 per person and limited entry to 200 persons (223:12/01/1986). This was sufficient to pay the band with a little left over for the sponsoring organization. (In the late 1980s, each youth dance averaged a net profit of $1,800) (223:28/02/1988). After 1971, the number of dances at the Community Center declined to an average of 8 per year or one dance every six weeks. After 1983, the number of dances increased again to an average of one per month.

In 1983, lay organizations sponsored about one dance each month. In 1984 and 1985, the parish itself began sponsoring a dance event in the church hall every month as a fundraiser (223:20/11/83). The pastor created a Dance Ministry with thirteen supervisors. Dance income in 1983 was $15,609 (223:12/02/84), $19,000.88 in 1984 and $12,470.55 in 1985. In 1986, the Dance Committee sponsored a dance every two months instead of one per month and limited ticket sales to 200 per dance (223: 12/01/1986), apparently in response to some trouble. The dances continued to be well supported until after 2000 when participation declined. By 2000, the number of dances had decreased to one or two a year, usually sponsored by one or both of the men’s groups, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesús and the Knights of Columbus.

Dance styles

Early Tex-Mex/Tejano dance style was influenced by the German style of dancing in a circle around the dance floor. In the 1960s and 1970s, Pop and R&B music led to new dance styles that supplemented traditional Mexican dance steps such as the Son. The bands also changed over time.

Tejano music was influenced by polka, rock, R&B, conjunto, mariachi, ranchera, Mexican cumbia and corridor. Bands could be classified as conjunto, orchestra/orquesta and modern. A conjunto band is composed of accordion, bajo sexton, bass and drums. An orquesta consists of bass, drums, electric guitar, synthesizer and a brass section. A modern Tejano band consists of synthesizers, drums, electric guitar, bass and perhaps an accordion (Wikipedia, Tejano music).

## Dance Ministry Membership List

The following persons helped with the Dance Ministry/Committee between 1983 and 1990. The Dance Committee may have ceased to operate after 1989. A Youth Dance Committee formed in 1990 and attempted to organize separate dances for adults and young people (223:22/07/1990).

In April 1983, Mrs. Mercy Lara, Mrs. Lucy Ramos, Margaret Garza and Stella Trejo helped at a dance (223:24/04/83). In July 1983, a dance committee led by José Jiménez organized dances to benefit the parish (223:17/07/83). All parishioners were invited to join the Dance Committee. In January, Rev. Underwood said, “We need more workers” (223:08/01/84).

In 1984 and 1985 there were 13 dance supervisors in the Dance Ministry (Progress Report of San Jose Parish for the Year 1985, Catholic Archives) (223:03/02/1985). In January 1986, the Dance Committee consisted of: Chairpersons: Margarito and Andrea Rodríguez and Gilbert and Rosie Tello; Music schedule: Victor Balderas and Manuel Navarro; Beer sales: Greg and Stella Trejo, Henry Saenz; Kitchen: Sylvia Polanco; Doorman: Paul Martínez; Beer license: Jesse Ortiz; Helpers: Raymond Castro and José Jiménez (223: 12/01/1986).

In 1986, the Pastor said that Jose Jimenez served for the past three years as Dance Committee Chairperson. During that time, he worked all the dances except for one when he was sick (223: 12/01/1986). He could not continue and, in December 1987, a meeting of the dance committee was called for those who wanted to work at the dances, including those who help in the kitchen. The greatest need was for a coordinator (223:06/12/1987). Arthur Treviño was the contact for the Dance Committee (223:24/01/1988).

The pastor appealed for adult supervisors in April 1989 (223:30/04/89). Apparently few parishioners volunteered and the Dance Committee is no longer mentioned in the Sunday Bulletin. In February 1990, a Youth Dance Committee led by Leticia Cásarez and Cindy Martinez organized Valentine dance for the young people. The income was listed under parish income as was the income from the previous Dance Committee (223:18/02/1990). By mid-summer, the SUAVE Youth Group seemed to have taken over the operation of the Dance Committee (223:27/05/1990). Because of poor attendance, the youth dances were switched from Friday to Sunday afternoons briefly and then back to Friday nights (223:15/04/1990).
